I feel like the trend is to brag about how little effort you had to put into something to make it. Maybe this isn't only a recent trend since saying you are better at something has been around for ages. Either way I see it as an unhealthy habit.

I think some of this tendency is a backlash against the slow moving systems in corporations. And some of it comes from a desire to motivate others to make things also, something like "look how easy it was for me, and it can be that easy for you too!" But nothing of any substance is that easy, and the discouragement they'll face when they realize that for the first time may stop them forever.

Making good things takes time. If someone tells you otherwise, ask for proof. And look at all the things they aren't counting.
