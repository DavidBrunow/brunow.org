It is so easy to get caught up in best practices and future features and processes and never get started. Just make something. What you make now will not be the final product. You cannot foresee the obstacles you will face no matter how much time you spend thinking about it ahead of time. Making things is painful and that pain is unavoidable.

Make something. Once you have something, you'll know where it needs to go next. Go there. Repeat.
