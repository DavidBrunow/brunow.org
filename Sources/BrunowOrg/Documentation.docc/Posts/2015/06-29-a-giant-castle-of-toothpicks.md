Some days software feels so fragile. I'll be notified about two or three completely unrelated issues from a few different applications and it feels like everything is broken.

On those days it feels like I'm building a giant castle out of individual toothpicks, none of which are held together by anything more than gravity and sheer will.

I know that these applications have a solid architecture and that bugs are unavoidable. I also know that I'm the go-to guy when no one else can solve a problem &mdash; so I'm going to see a lot more brokenness than most.

But knowing that doesn't help the feeling that I'm going to bump into a wall and accidentally knock the whole thing down. I'll just have to sleep that off.
