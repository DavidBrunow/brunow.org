I've always heard that anger is a secondary emotion. However tonight I researched the topic on Wikipedia and found it described there as a primary emotion. But that doesn't fit with my personal experience. I feel two distinct stages &mdash; a feeling of helplessness or unfairness or hurt followed by a surge in anger.

If you experience anger the way I do then I think you have a chance to reduce the anger you feel. If you notice the helplessness first then you know you can take action, or come to peace with the fact that you can't change everything, to feel less anger. If you notice hurt first then you may be able to discuss that hurt with the person that caused it.

What makes you angry and what are you going to do about it?
