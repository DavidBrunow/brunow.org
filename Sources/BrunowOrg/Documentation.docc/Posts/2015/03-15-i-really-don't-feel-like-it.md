I really don't feel like writing this blog post. I didn't feel like recording a podcast a few days ago either. I'm just not in the mood. I'm tired, I haven't gotten much sleep the last few nights because my back has been hurting, and I'm just not in a great mood.

But I'm doing it anyway. Because I know that moods are like seasons that will come and go. I cannot rely upon them. No one could rely on me if I did.

So I shipped another episode of my podcast even though I didn't feel like it. I'm writing this right now even though I just want to lay in bed and read. I don't write every day because I want to write every day. From the outside it is easy to look at everyone who consistently ships generous things and assume that they are always in the mood to do so. It is easy to use that assumption to make excuses for ourselves to not ship.

Me not being in the mood tonight is a tremendous opportunity. I can tell you &mdash; while in the midst of a funk &mdash; that I'm doing it anyway.
