A long time ago I went to massage therapy school. I never got my certification but I can give a darn good massage thanks to it. Tonight I was thinking about one of the fundamental rules when giving someone a massage: always maintain contact with the person. If you need to move from one part of the body to another, like the left arm to the neck, make sure you keep a hand on the person you are massaging throughout that transition.

Maintaining contact provides comfort. The person knows where you are (and therefore where you aren't.) She can infer why you are in a position from knowing your position so she doesn't feel anxious about what's going on.

Client service needs the same fundamental rule. Never get to the point where your client doesn't know where you are. Don't let them get anxious. Regularly stay in contact and over-explain what you're doing.
