It is easy to get caught up in the everyday life you live with the job, group of friends, and family you've always had. It is easy to keep consuming the same content you've been consuming &mdash; the same TV shows or blogs or podcasts &mdash; and enjoy that and not seek out anything different.

I highly recommend finding something different that challenges the way you think. Not in a harsh way. On your own terms. A book with ideas that you don't agree with or watch some video on YouTube or listen to a podcast that paints something you do in a negative light.

Make a habit of this. I don't think I could do more than one new thing a month because it isn't easy if you're doing it right. I've started with two right now because I came across them by circumstance before I knew what I was doing.

My current two things are a [video series from Anita Sarkeesian](http://youtu.be/4ZPSrwedvsg) about the objectification of women in video games and a book called [Searching for God Knows What](https://itun.es/us/MP4mK.l) about finding God.

If I take them seriously and take the time to think about them, exposing myself to these different points of view will challenge me to figure out what I really believe. It will make me find out why I believe what I do. It will give me a glimpse of what it is like to see through someone else's eyes.
