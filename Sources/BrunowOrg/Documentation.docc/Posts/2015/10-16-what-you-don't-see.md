When building a business, what you don't see is the stuff that matters. A customer that trusts you and tells their friends. The group of people that read your blog posts and see you as a source of wisdom or inspiration but never contact you. The effort you put into building systems that only seem natural once they are in place.

All of that is pushing your roots deeper into the soil. Creating stability and longevity.

It isn't flashy and at times it is boring. But you have to follow your gut, do what's right, and trust that good results will come from it.
