This post is another in my series of rules that I use to help me navigate the ambiguities of life.

Take off your sunglasses you are having a conversation with another person, especially if you are meeting them for the first time. I don't mean when you are just sitting around shooting the shit, but during any conversation where you should be looking someone in the eyes you shouldn't be wearing your sunglasses.
