I had a few hiccups in my daily learning habit this month due to a trip to San Francisco and getting a little bit of a cold. I've also found it much harder to get excited about the topics I've chosen this time around &mdash; I don't know if that speaks to how good the Stanford iOS 8 and Swift class was or just that I prefer more practical topics that don't contain a lot of higher level math. Here is what I've learned about:
