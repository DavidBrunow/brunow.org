Caring about everything is as effective as caring about nothing. You have to force yourself to ignore 90% of the things the world wants you to care about so you can focus on that other 10% &mdash; the 10% that you've figured out, over time, matters to you the most.

Sometimes you'll put something in that 10% that doesn't belong and that's part of the learning process. But take it back out once you realize it is in the wrong spot.

Set yourself up for situations where you don't have to say no. Do what you can to put blinders on and ignore everything outside your focus. Just knowing it is out there takes energy and attention away from your important things.
