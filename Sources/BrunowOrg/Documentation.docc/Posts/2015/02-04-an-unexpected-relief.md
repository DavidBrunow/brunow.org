Today we learned that the hole in my daughter's heart had closed. We expected this would happen &mdash; her cardiologist recommended against surgery because in most cases this issue just goes away on its own. For the last four years I fully believed that as fact.

Despite that fact, I felt a tremendous sense of relief today when hearing those words from the doctor. A burden that I didn't even know I was carrying around was released while tears came to my eyes and a smile to my lips.

I'm interested in all the other things that are weighing on my subconscious. How do I know they are there when I can only feel them leaving? I wonder if this is something that meditation or just spending time with your thoughts can help with.
