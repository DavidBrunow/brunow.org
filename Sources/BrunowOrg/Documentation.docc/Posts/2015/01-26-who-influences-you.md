I think it's good to take a few minutes every once in a while and figure out who you are allowing to shape your life. As highly social creatures, we readily pick up on thoughts and habits in our environment that we may not notice in our daily lives. Fortunately, many of us have control over that environment &mdash; we can choose who we are around (both digitally and in the physical world), what we read, and the television we watch.

I explicitly choose not to let cable news have an influence on me because I don't want it shaping who I am. I do the same with people that seem to constantly complain on Twitter, "high drama" friends that always need attention, and reality TV.

Instead, I read and listen to [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com), [Merlin Mann](http://www.merlinmann.com) (although he can be complain-y at times at which point I have to take some time away), [Joel Spolsky](http://joelonsoftware.com), [Steven Pressfield](http://www.stevenpressfield.com), [Dan Benjamin](http://danbenjamin.com), [Shawn Blanc](http://shawnblanc.net), and [Horace Dediu](http://www.asymco.com). I spend time with my girlfriend, close friends that provide support and that I can support, and my daughter. I try to surround myself with as much positive energy as possible.

If you haven't in a while, think about who and what is influencing you. Consider whether you need to do some pruning.
