I have part 3 of my rules for making things coming tomorrow &mdash; I've had a busy evening and I am getting to this post late and I want to spend more time on that one. So I'll interrupt that series with an observation I've had lately.

99% of the time you will not notice who you influence. But the silent majority of people you interact with will take something away from their time with you.

Will they take away something positive or negative? Is your ego OK with not having those people tell you that you touched their lives? Are you putting the things you want into the world?
