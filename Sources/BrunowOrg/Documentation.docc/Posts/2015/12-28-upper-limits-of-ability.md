Every few months I'll pick up one of my side projects again &mdash; apps that I've been working on for years. What I find is a lot of functionality and code that I'd never permit myself to build or write today. I see bugs or missing features everywhere. I see code put together in a way that just doesn't make sense.

I see all that because I'm not the same person I was when I last worked on that project. I've learned, gained experience, and gotten better. And I'm confident that the next time I pick up this project I'll feel the exact same way again &mdash; I'll see a subpar product.

That's ok. That's getting better. There's nothing wrong with running into the upper limits of your abilities today. Just keep pushing those limits.
