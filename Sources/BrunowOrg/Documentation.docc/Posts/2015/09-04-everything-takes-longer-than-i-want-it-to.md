I've been working on one of my simpler apps &mdash; it only has three screens &mdash; and it has taken me far longer than I wanted it to. I thought I'd be done by the end of July, but other things that took longer than I wanted them to got in the way. That's the way it works.

I'm having to readjust my mindset about it a bit. I've always taken pride in getting things done quickly, but I'm understanding how much more important quality is than inflating my pride. It feels painful to push something back, and to explain to someone else that it has taken longer than I want it to. But that's part of the doing things right. You have to take that extra time.
