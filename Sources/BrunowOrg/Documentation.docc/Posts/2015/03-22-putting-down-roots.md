Over the past fifteen years I have had 15 different addresses in three states and two countries. I've moved around a lot. That frequency of moving changes my mindset about things and makes everything seem temporary. No need to have a lot of things because that's just more things to move.

It has worn on me though. It is tough to maintain friendships, to find a place you belong, and to work to improve your home when you know that it will all be short lived. I've built up a form of detachment from everything over the years.

I want to change that now. I've found a home in Denton that I love and a community that I want to be a part of. I'm ready to put down my roots and build something lasting.
