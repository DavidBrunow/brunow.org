Whenever I travel by plane I like to wait until the very last minute before getting on the plane. While everyone else is jockeying for a good place in line, I'm sitting and relaxing. Until recently I didn't know why they would be up like that for no reason.

Then I realized that they wanted something different than I did. They had a carry on that they wanted to be able to stow close to their seat. I put my carry on items in a bag small enough to put under the seat in front of me.

This idea can be applied throughout life. You can choose to try to be the best in a competition or you can choose to avoid the competition entirely.

Just want something different.
