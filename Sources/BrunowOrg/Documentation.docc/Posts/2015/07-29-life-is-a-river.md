Life is not a highway. Highways are straight and have easily defined distances, landmarks, and destinations. We try to force those into our lives through birthdays and graduations and anniversaries &mdash; things to look forward to and remember. We try to straighten and pave the river, but rivers can't be paved.

When you move to the edges of society you notice the river more. Anyone exceptional &mdash; slow or fast or smart or dumb or different &mdash; has experienced the meandering path the river takes. They've felt the rapids and the slow peaceful flat parts and the dams and the pointy rocks.

I believe that not acknowledging the river, trying to pave over it and smooth it out into a straight line of our design, leaves us feeling hollow. Our false sense of control makes us out of touch with our world.

You aren't in control. Feel the current. Let it carry you where it will.
