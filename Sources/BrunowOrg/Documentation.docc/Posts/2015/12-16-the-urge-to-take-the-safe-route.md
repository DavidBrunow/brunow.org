I'm working on an estimate right now for a potential client. The company has an internal server and it looking to upgrade it. I believe their server needs are modest &mdash; they do very little with it and don't have many users.

With their minimal needs I'd recommend a fairly inexpensive server (if I recommend a server at all as opposed to moving things to the cloud.) But I have this urge to recommend something with more power just in case. It feels safer to do that.

The problem is that that isn't what is best for the client. And me playing it safe validates everyone else's fears and they compensate similarly, delivering something over-powered and over-priced.

I'm going to take note of my fear and my desire to do things the safe way. And then fight through them and propose what I know is best.
