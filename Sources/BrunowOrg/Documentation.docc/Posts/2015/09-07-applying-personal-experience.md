I've had a lower back injury for the last ten years and I'm in varying levels of pain every day. I've just started a new app that I ope will help me control that pain better and I'm able to approach it from the point of view of someone living in chronic pain. That point of view will help me make a better app. That point of view is the important part of making things &mdash; much more important than the technical specs and software stack.

What personal experience do you have that you can bring to a project?
