Nothing and no one is more likely to ruin your plans than yourself. Talking yourself out of exercise, repeatedly hanging out with people that bring out the worst in you, listening to that fear in your head that tells you not to take the risk. That's all you blowing yourself up.

The great thing about this is that you are the one thing that you have almost complete control over. You can make the changes you want. You don't have to look outside yourself. Really, you shouldn't look outside yourself, stop looking outside yourself!

Focus on what you can control. Focus on setting up the right systems and getting into good habits.
