How easily could someone copy what you do tomorrow? Could someone in Vietnam make the same thing you do but at a third of the price? Will the bank down the street offer the same rates on loans?

Right this moment I can think of two ways to resist being copied.

The first is relationships. Relationships are inherently unique. We build a different bond with each person we meet. No one else can replicate your relationships.

The second is building a large system of interconnected pieces, each under your control. This one is difficult and the key is integration. Any potential copies will seem shallow and hollow because they don't work as well with the rest of the world.

If you can be copied your success will probably be short lived.
