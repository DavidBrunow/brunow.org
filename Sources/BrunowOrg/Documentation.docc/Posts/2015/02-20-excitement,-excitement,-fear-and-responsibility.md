Closing the sale, making the plans, then realizing "oh shit I have to follow through on this." I find that the first two are so much fun. Dreaming about how much you can help these other people. Then finding out that she believes you can help her too. Then making plans together &mdash; the future is wide open!

These parts are fun because you have no responsibility yet. You don't have to deliver, after all no one sells them all. You haven't made any promises yet. You have no commitment to her.

But then everything goes to plan and you get the opportunity you want. Embrace the fear. Feel it in your belly and go forward. It will pass. It won't be easy and at times you may think you can't do it and you may want to give up. But if you keep moving forward you will succeed.
