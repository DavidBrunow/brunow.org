In my experience there are two important hurdles in the way of getting good at something: not knowing what good looks like and not knowing how to change something that isn't good to make it good.

Getting past each of those hurdles takes time. More time solving a certain type of problem will improve your taste and you'll start to learn what good looks like. More time looking at what you've made and comparing it to things that you think are good will make you see how good things are put together.

I don't think either can be rushed. Spend time doing them. After a month or two look back and see how far you've come.
