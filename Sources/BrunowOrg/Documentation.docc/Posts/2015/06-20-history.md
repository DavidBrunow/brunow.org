I believe that if we look back at our history and we aren't offended by parts of it then we aren't making progress. And I believe that it is important to make sure we don't hide the parts of our history that we are ashamed of and offended by. It is important to remember them.

By remembering them we remember and honor the struggle that those who freed us from them went through. And we give ourselves proof that we can make it through similar struggles today.

We do ourselves no good by pretending these things didn't happen.
