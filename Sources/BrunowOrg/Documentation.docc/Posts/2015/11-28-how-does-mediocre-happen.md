We watched two mediocre movies tonight. Each was free with a TV package we already pay for and since we are tight on money right now we decided to try them rather than renting a movie that was more likely to be good. We went into each movie with fairly low expectations and we were still underwhelmed.

This makes me wonder how these types of movies get made. In other words, what causes the mediocrity? They each had a famous cast, most of whom had been in other good movies. Did they have young directors? Was the story just so bad it couldn't be salvaged? Was the singular goal to make a movie that would gross a certain amount while staying under a certain cost?

I don't know enough about the movie industry to say. But I don't think it differs greatly from every other industry. So how do mediocre things get created?
