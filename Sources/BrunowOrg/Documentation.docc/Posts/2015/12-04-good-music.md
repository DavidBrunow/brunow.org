I don't understand why I like music the way I do. It doesn't make logical sense to me that hearing a good beat will make me want to tap my feet and nod my head. But it does. I love a good beat or a good sound in a song.

I've recently created a playlist I've called "Hot Right Now." It isn't too difficult for me to choose to add a song to it, although it has got to be a good some. But I have one firm, main rule about removing songs &mdash; if I ever want to skip it then it comes off the list. This is the playlist I wake up to every morning and listen to when I need to hear something great.

I'd love to share it with you. If you have Apple Music, here is [a link](Listen to Hot Right Now by David on @AppleMusic.
