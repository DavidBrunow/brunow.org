For many years I've heard the word seamless and known its meaning but I didn't really *feel* it. I don't know what happened in the last few months to change that for me &mdash; maybe it was one of Jony Ive's talks about the products he creates.

The word holds so much more meaning for me now. You cannot tell how a seamless product was put together because it was put together with such thought and skill. You cannot tell where it begins and it ends because it extends beyond its physical bounds into a bigger part of your life.

As I create things each day I hold them up to the seamless standard and I usually fall short, but I find it is a great way to visualize my goals.
