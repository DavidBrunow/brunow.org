If you are entering a competition, contest, or submitting something you created to someone else for approval, what are you asking for? 

Are you asking for money? If so, is the money they are offering enough to do what you want to do? And is there some way you can create a very cheap version of what you want to make to help share your vision?

Are you asking for legitimacy? Do you fear you're thing isn't good enough? Do you want someone else, someone "who knows," to tell you that you are?

Are you asking for publicity? Will more people see what you're doing if you work with this group?

I believe figuring out what you are asking for matters. It matters not only to better know yourself, but also to better approach the problem of "how do I get this submission selected."
