Over the last few days I've been teaching things that I've done so much that they've become second nature. Simple things, well simple to me, like using a three finger drag to move items on a Mac. Or when it is appropriate to retweet. Really simple things, except they aren't.

If you're ever feeling you don't have any worth, find someone that wants to learn about something that is second nature to you. You'll see there is much more to you than you realize.
