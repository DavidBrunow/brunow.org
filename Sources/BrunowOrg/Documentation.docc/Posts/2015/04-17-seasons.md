It is so easy to get caught up in the everyday going ons of life, to focus on the impact of this one thing on you at this very point in time.

It is so easy to forget that everything is changing constantly while we have our heads down in the details of those going ons. We forget to look up to see the fresh buds in the spring and the colorful leaves still on the trees in the fall.

We don't have the perspective we need to see where those individual details fit with the passing of time and the changing of the seasons. We forget that we must plant things now to see them blossom later.

Rhythms are relaxing. Planes passing over head, one every few minutes. Ocean waves traveling towards the shore endlessly. Each brings change.  Each fits in perfectly with all the others. Just like the seasons, fulfilling their purpose as they come and go.
