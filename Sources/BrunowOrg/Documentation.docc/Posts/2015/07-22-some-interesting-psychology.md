I've been working on a project for about a month and I'm getting close to wrapping it up. I've gone way over my estimated budget for a variety of reasons and I'm completely OK with that, including the part where I eat any of the costs for going over.

But I found my thought process interesting during this project. When I was getting close to reaching my estimated amount of hours I was very stressed out about it. I think it was a combination about not wanting to be wrong with my initial estimate and judging my abilities to be lacking because I wasn't meeting my goal.

But now that I'm way over, I'm not stressed about it at all. At some point, for some reason, my attitude changed and I'm not sure why.
