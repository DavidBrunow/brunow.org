Probably my favorite thing about starting a company is that we get to decide the rules. I don't like the traditional business rules &mdash; things like super-secrecy, cutting corners, maximizing profits, and pushing yourself ahead at the expense of someone else. This new company is part experiment &mdash; can our ideas of how a company should be run work in the real world?

One of my strongest principles in life is that I should approach any situation with the question of "what can I give to this" rather than "what can I get out of this." I believe that this attitude has served me well personally. Generosity brings me joy and takes my mind away from what I want.

Our new company will follow this same principle. We will share more about exactly what that means soon and we will share what we learn as we go. It is going to be a fun experiment.
