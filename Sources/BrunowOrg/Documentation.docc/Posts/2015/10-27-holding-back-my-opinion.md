I'm a smart, opinionated person. I heavily research any areas that I am interested in or that I need to know about. But I still find myself holding back my opinions or softening them in such a way that they aren't really opinions anymore but simply plain vanilla statements.

I know the reason why I do this. I've been feeling it more lately. I'm scared that I'll be held accountable by the person I am recommending something to and I am afraid of that responsibility. Part of me doesn't want to be on the hook for that.

I'm working on it. When I feel that fear and resistance I power through them and work to share my full opinion without holding anything back.
