If you can find a way to make money that is different than everyone else in your industry then you will have a huge advantage over them. You can compete in a different way since your values will be different. If you make money from, and therefore value, billable hours giving music lessons then you can reduce your rates on something you don't value as much, such as studio time.

You aren't competing head to head at that point and theoretically, this can give you an advantage. Of course, the real key is to decide which factors to compete on and how well you can do at those.
