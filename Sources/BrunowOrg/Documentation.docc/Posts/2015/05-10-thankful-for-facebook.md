A couple of days ago I searched Facebook for an Army buddy of mine that I haven't seen in almost 10 years. I'd looked for him at different times over the years and never found him. But this time I saw his smiling face as he sat with his daughter and tears came to my eyes. I was so happy to see him happy.

I'm so very thankful for that experience.

Tonight I was looking through old pictures and feeling nostalgic. I'm missing the people that have passed through my life that I haven't seen for years. Fortunately I can find many of them on Facebook.

But Facebook just leaves me wanting more. I want to sit around with my Army buddies and have a drink and catch up and Facebook can't do that. Despite all our advances, geographic distance still separates us.
