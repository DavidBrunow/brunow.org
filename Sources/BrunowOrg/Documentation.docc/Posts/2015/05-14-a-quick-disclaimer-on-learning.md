In general, I don't believe you should strive to learn about more things. I don't believe that it is effective to learn about the newest tools or products that can make your work and life better. A very little of that is OK, especially learning about updates to the tools you use every day, but it will quickly become noise that distracts you.

I do believe you should learn every day, but I believe that you should learn concepts. A diverse information diet of concepts will make you better at what you do and smarter overall as your mind naturally makes connections between the concepts you know and those you are learning.

Ignore the noise and dig into something deep and interesting.
