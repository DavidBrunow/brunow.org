I've slacked on my learning habit &mdash; actually I fell out of most of my good habits somewhere over the last couple months and haven't been able to get back into them consistently. But I'm still learning, just at a slower pace.

This last month I took most of [Coursera's "What a Plant Knows" course](https://www.coursera.org/course/plantknows). Fascinating stuff and I highly recommend taking it or reading [the book authored by the professor for the course](https://itun.es/us/gt3SD.l).
