I'm a "rules oriented" person. I navigate life by following these rules &mdash; these rules make the day to day much simpler.

I'm going to start sharing these rules here in my "David's Rules" series. This is the first &mdash; although each of these is equally important and this order is arbitrary &mdash; about apologies:

Always apologize for your mistakes. And make it a real apology &mdash; say "I'm sorry" rather than "I apologize". "I apologize" is something someone says when they don't really mean it.

But only apologize once for something &mdash; anything more makes your regret the other person's problem and you don't need that, you already did something wrong.
