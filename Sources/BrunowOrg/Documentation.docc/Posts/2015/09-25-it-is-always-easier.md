To break something than to put it together. To destroy something than to build it. To hack something than to secure it. To attack something than to defend it. To waste your time than to spend it wisely. To avoid fears rather than confronting them.

But we humans don't crave easy. Many times we like easy, but we crave meaning. Meaning lies along the path of the hard way.
