I've often said to myself "it doesn't matter" to try to relax about something weighing on my mind, but that isn't right. Telling myself it doesn't matter lessens the work I do and creates barriers within myself as the parts of my brain fight &mdash; the parts that know it matters and the parts that are just trying to make me feel better.

"It will take care of itself" is much better. I can admit I care, it is obvious that I do. And I can let go. It's not all on me, I don't have to control it.

It will take care of itself.
