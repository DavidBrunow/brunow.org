I love stories that end with a happily ever after. Or ones where a person hits it big and doesn't have to worry anymore. All the problems are solved and life is a dream.

My life to this point hasn't been anything like that and I can't really hold out hope that that will change. And my reality is more likely similar to that of many people who always feel like life is a struggle. I can't argue that it isn't.

I don't think any of us ever get out of the woods. Instead we have to find our peace in each moment. Notice the ways that life and our emotions and internal dialog are pulling us. Acknowledge them &mdash; say to yourself "this is what struggle feels like". Then enjoy it. Let it wash over you. Soon this thought and feeling will be gone, replaced by another.
