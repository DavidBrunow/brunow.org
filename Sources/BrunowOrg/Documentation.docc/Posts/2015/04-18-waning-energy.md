A week ago I was praising a morning routine and how it was making my days better. This week I realized one of the key parts of that morning routine is getting enough sleep the night before.

I've had some early morning and late night obligations this week which lowered my just over 8 hours of sleep per night average down to just over 7. I'm dragging. I have little energy to do anything new, I'm not being social, I'm having to force myself through my obligations, my writing is kinda crappy, and silly little things make me angry. I don't trust this me.

It seems like the popular wisdom these days is that you don't need much sleep, especially if you are driven to do something great. I don't buy it. Sleep is critical.
