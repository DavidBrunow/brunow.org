My ingrained reaction to challenging someone to do something new or just at the end of their limits is "don't do that, you might push her too far and she'll fail and never want to do it again." I think that's a natural fear to have.

But I think most of us in most situations will respond to failing like that with a reaction like "that's not so bad" and we will get back up and try again. We are wired to persevere until we overcome our challenges &mdash; anyone doing otherwise has trained herself out of her nature. That's why we put up with falling a hundred times before walking, or riding a bike, or finding the person we love.
