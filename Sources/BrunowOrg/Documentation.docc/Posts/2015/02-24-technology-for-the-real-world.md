As a technology enthusiast it is fun to get caught up in the cutting edge technology and latest gadgets. Most of the time I live out of touch with how "real" people use and feel about the whole technology world. I'm lost in my shiny, minimalist world that doesn't have the usual real world constraints.

Nothing has really been at stake with things I've designed before &mdash; I design applications that had utility beyond what they looked like so their design didn't matter as much. My latest challenge is designing for the real people. The design is everything. A small business is at stake. Will my design do its job and connect with those real people?

This role is invigorating and surreal. If we fail a person may lose their job. But if we succeed then we could change a good man's life. He has put his trust in us.
