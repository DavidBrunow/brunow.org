One of my favorite things about starting our business has been finding out more about who we are and then turning that into what Shepherd Dog is. Every decision is an opportunity to discuss our beliefs and make something out of them. 

Choosing a phone system (and deciding whether you even need a phone,) deciding on the signature on your emails, and determining your pricing model and rates all add up to this new thing that you've created. When your company is small like ours is, we have nearly ultimate control over what it is.

I started thinking about this because I read a tweet about franchises and thought that that business model isn't right for me. In a franchise you're building someone else's vision and missing out on all the fun parts.
