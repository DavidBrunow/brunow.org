I wish I was better at handling frustration. It builds up inside me and I don't know how to handle it. How do I release it in a healthy way?

I still haven't found a solution for this one so I won't be able to share any magic bullet. In the past I've been able to get myself so sad &mdash; by doing something like watching a sad movie &mdash; that I was able to cry and just get all the pent up emotions out. That isn't working as well as it used to.

Now it just builds and builds. I think relaxing days can reduce the pressure a little, but not nearly enough to balance it out.

With the pressure comes an emotional exhaustion. Everything feels more difficult because I'm tired. It dulls my view of the world &mdash; instead of feeling bright and shiny it feels like it had a coating of dust.

It could be that I just have too many things weighing on me right now. I have a looming work deadline and the stress of starting our business and making ends meet and maybe this frustration feels so heavy because of everything else I'm carrying. I'll have to think about that more, but not right now.

Right now I'm just so tired.
