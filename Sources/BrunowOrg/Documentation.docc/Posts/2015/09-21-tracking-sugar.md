I've started tracking my "added sugar" intake. I'm counting any sugars printed on the back of a processed food as added sugar and my intention is to figure out how much added sugar I consume. The point isn't to say "this is bad" or "this is good," but simply to know.

But it hasn't worked out that way for me. Just the act of tracking my sugar intake causes me to reduce it. It is funny how that works.

In case you're curious, here is my sugar intake for the last week:
