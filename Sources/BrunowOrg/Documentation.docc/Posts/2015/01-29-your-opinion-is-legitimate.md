Being relatively new to my career path I find myself hesitant to share my opinion with the broader community. I think that since I am new that my opinion doesn't count. I feel like I should sit back and listen and learn from all the very smart people and keep my mouth shut.

I need to overcome that. I need to know that my opinion is always legitimate, especially when I come to it from a position of thoughtfulness and caring. That doesn't mean that my opinion is right, but it is always worth sharing. I can learn only so much through listening alone &mdash; I also need to test my opinions by sharing them.
