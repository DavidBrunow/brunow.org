I have written a blog post every day for the last six months. Over that time I've shared a couple of other habits that I've tried to start &mdash; they have all fallen away. But I've stuck with writing every day.

Is it easier now than it was 6 months ago? Nope.

Do I feel like I write better posts than I did 6 months ago? Nope, but I haven't gone back to read those ones to see how far I've come.

At this point, I don't see the same value in this habit as I did in the beginning. That happened with the other habits I've tried on too and I think it is natural. I don't think it means that there isn't value, I just think it means sticking with things is hard.

I'm going to stick with this one though. I've thought about stopping a few times but I'm just not ready to give up.

I am going to change my process a little though. I've been writing these posts last thing at night before I go to bed and I just don't have much creative energy at that point in the day. Tonight I've started two drafts before thinking "I don't have the energy to do this topic justice."

So I'm going to try to move my writing time earlier in the day. I'm not sure exactly how to make that work, but I think it will be better.

Here's to six more months!
