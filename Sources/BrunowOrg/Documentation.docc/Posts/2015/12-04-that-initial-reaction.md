It is easy to get swept up in your first reaction to hearing something. Easy to follow your gut and stick with the initial way you feel. But it doesn't work a lot of the time. The world isn't clear cut so your reaction probably has at least parts that are wrong. And your gut doesn't know all the facts. More often than not it is operating from fear and other survival instincts which aren't relevant for logical discussions.

It is ok to not know how you feel about something. It is ok to do research and soul searching to figure out why your gut reaction is what it is. It is ok to change your mind and it is ok to keep it the same, depending on the circumstances.
