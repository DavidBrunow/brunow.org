In my more tired and weak moments I find myself easily frustrated with the weaknesses of different groups of people. For example, the old with their slowness and hesitation, and the young with their lack of focus. In my weaker moments I see these as obstacles.

But I've learned to remind myself of the truth when I find my thoughts going in that bad direction. I've learned to tell myself that everything worth doing takes all kinds of people. The young balance the old with their relentless enthusiasm and drive to move forward. The old balance the young with their wisdom and focus. Building a healthy community requires that balance. It takes all kinds of people to get that.
