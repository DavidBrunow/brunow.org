We don't have much time.

Every moment we get closer to losing everyone we care about. And each of them gets a moment closer to losing you.

But we can't stand still and only spend time with them. We must move forward.

But we must also remember to feel the pain that comes with time slipping by. 

And enjoy every moment of it.
