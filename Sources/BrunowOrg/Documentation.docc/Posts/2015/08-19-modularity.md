It seems like technical people love to try to make everything modular. They try to make everything in as many replaceable and interchangeable pieces as possible. Modularity has benefits like being able to replace single components instead of the entire system.

But personally, I don't want to have to worry about the different components of my things. I don't want to have a modular phone because I'd have to spend time and energy figuring out the right combination of parts that will work best for me. Modularity is great, but I want a layer of polish on top of it. I just want things to work together without me having to be involved or think about it.
