Once again I didn’t do a good job of keeping track of my daily learning in August, but like June and July it was all about WWDC.

I made it through another 16 videos and have 14 left to watch from this year.

Once again I also spent time watching videos from previous years &mdash; this time to learn more about In App Purchase for a project I’m working on.
