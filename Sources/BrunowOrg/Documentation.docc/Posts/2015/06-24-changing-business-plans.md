Today I heard from a local small business owner about how often he has had to change his business plan because the plan didn't fit with real life. We've definitely been doing the same thing and I think it is critical to running a business the right way. 

Since we want to help other small businesses, we have to look at what they need and how we can provide that. We can't just stick with our initial thoughts about how the world works even though we've gathered more information that tells us different. And we can't just do what we want to do if we truly want to be in a role of serving our clients. We have to go to what they need.

You'll always need some limits of "that type of work isn't for us," but I'd recommend reevaluating those each time you confront another decision about them. You might be clinging to old data and world views. It might be time to change plans.
