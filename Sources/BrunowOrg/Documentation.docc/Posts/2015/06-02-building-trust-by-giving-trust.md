One of the quickest ways you can erode my trust is by asking me to sign something at the wrong time. Like an NDA before you discuss a project with me or a contract in a situation where a friendly handshake would do.

My policy is when in doubt, trust. You trusting me will make me trust you more. A positive cycle.
