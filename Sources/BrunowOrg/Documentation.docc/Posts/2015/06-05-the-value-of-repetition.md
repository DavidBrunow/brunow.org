I have a pretty good memory and get bored fairly easily. That combination makes it difficult for me to sit through and pay attention to stories that I've heard before. Because of my distaste for it, I rarely tell the same story to the same person and I try to limit myself to only saying things once.

I'm starting to believe that good communication requires repetition. Not saying the same thing in the same words over and over, but changing the phrasing and the concepts at play in order to make the same point. This is especially true if you have a distracted audience and it is tough to find one that's not.

So I'm going to try a new communication strategy where I don't treat everyone like I want to be treated and start repeating myself more.
