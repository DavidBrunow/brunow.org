You can't create a revolutionary new thing overnight in one fell swoop. Instead you take little steps one at a time. Only your close friends and family will see all the little steps it takes. Then one day the steps have added up and you've made a good thing. Not revolutionary and not even great, but good. You can be proud of it.

But this thing won't be the revolutionary new thing. This thing is a little step forward on your path.
