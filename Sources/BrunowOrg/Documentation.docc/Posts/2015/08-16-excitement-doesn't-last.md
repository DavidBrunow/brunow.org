You're excited now and things are easy. You want to get up and go. You want to show how much you care. You want to change the world.

That excitement won't last. It will fade within the first few weeks. You'll start to question whether you were right to be excited at all. You'll think the lack of excitement means you're going down the wrong path.

If you have a chance of following through you need to anticipate this change. You need to prepare yourself for that point where all you have is willpower and a desire to see the change you initially wanted to make and a desire to see it through to completion. You need to pace yourself so you have the strength to fight through it.
