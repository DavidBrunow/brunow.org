What if the penalties in football were more like the penalties in the corporate world? What if, instead of negating any forward progress, penalties were simply subtracted from the gains?

This would create a remarkably different game. There'd be penalties on every down! A holding call on a 15 yard run would result in a 10 yard gain. Penalties would no longer be a deterrent to illegal play, they'd just be part of a good strategy.
