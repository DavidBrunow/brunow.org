Another post in [my series of David's Rules](http://brunow.org/2015/01/31/david's-rules---apologies/):

If you ask someone for their recommendation, for example a server at a restaurant, you must follow their recommendation. Doing otherwise is the same thing as telling them that their opinion is worthless.
