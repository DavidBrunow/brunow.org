The definition of expert is "a person who has a comprehensive and authoritative knowledge of or skill in a particular area." But what does that really mean in a world filled with information that is growing exponentially by the day? That definition of expert could only apply to the narrowest of topics, such as "he is an expert in Microsoft Office 2013."

But can you take the definition of expert broader? Could you say someone is a technology expert? So much technology exists and so much innovation is occurring that no one person can know technology authoritatively. And I don't think the lack of expertise only applies to a field like technology. The complexity takes over too quickly. Doctors become experts at single joints or organs. Which is fine but comes at a high cost &mdash; an entire team must be deployed to solve a problem.

Most people don't have the resources for an entire team. The health insurance industry has risen to "solve" that problem. But we don't have a technology insurance industry to handle paying for teams to solve your technological problems. Most can't afford to have an email person and a web person and an app person and a server person, each authoritative experts in her own field.

In most cases, expertise is not what you need. You need someone that is able to solve your problem and that you can afford to pay. Someone you can trust to do the job right and treat you fairly.
