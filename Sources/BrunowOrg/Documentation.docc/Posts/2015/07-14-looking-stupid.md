One of my bigger fears is looking stupid. I've kind of always known this but recently I felt some resistance that brought it to the front of my mind.

While working on an app I've been using a design pattern that feels a little bit dirty to me. I'll cover the details in a later post, but in general it feels like what I am trying to do should be easier than it is and that always makes me think I'm doing it wrong.

The resistance came when I thought about writing a blog post about this design pattern. I didn't want to do it. After thinking about why for a bit I realized that I didn't want to look stupid. I feared everyone looking at what I wrote and saying "I can't believe you did it that way that is so dumb." I feared being seen as a fraud.

Now that I've found this fear and resistance I'm going to lean into it. I'm going to start writing blog posts about those things that I fear will make me look stupid or like I don't know what I'm doing.
