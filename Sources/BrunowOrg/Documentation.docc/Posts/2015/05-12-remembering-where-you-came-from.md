I'm very good at living in the present and generally that is a good thing. I truly believe that constantly living in the past or future won't bring you any good.

But you must remember that you are the sum of everything you've done and everyone you've met in your life. You bring them with you everyday but it is simple to forget that while living in the present.

Don't build shrines to the past, but don't forget it either. Regularly take time to reminisce and interact with people you haven't thought about or seen in years. You'll be reminded of parts of you that you've forgotten.
