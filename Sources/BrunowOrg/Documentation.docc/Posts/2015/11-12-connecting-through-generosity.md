Over the last 9 months as we've started our business and worked to create a client base we have used one method to connect with others that has been foolproof so far. We've been generous with no expectation of getting anything back. As we hoped it would, this builds trust and great relationships.

It also has another great side effect &mdash; it helps you weed out the people you don't want to work with. If you give generously over and over and all they ask for is for you to give more then things won't work out long term. Find a way to separate yourself.

But the percentage of the population that wants to take advantage of you is small. Don't let them change your ways. Start with generosity and an open mind and go from there.
