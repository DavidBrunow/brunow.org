I have three points of using social media. 

I want to share who I am with the world in the hope of finding like minded people and make more friends. 

I want to share the things I and our company build in the interest of promoting our work, letting people know about things we've made that could benefit them, and giving people an easy way to share anything about us.

I want to have lightweight and topical conversations with the people I friend and follow.

I don't want a massive following and numerous likes. I want to reach the people that are on my same wavelength.

I don't want massive influence, but I hope to build a solid reputation amongst those people on my wavelength.

What are your points of using social media?
