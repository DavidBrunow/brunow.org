There is harm in asking.

Next time it is less likely you'll get a chance to ask. Ask too soon and you're sure to be written off as someone who takes and doesn't give.

Don't ask. Give with no expectation of receiving. Do and make great things. Don't be an asshole but be yourself.

Do those things and people will want to work with you. People will want to see you succeed and will go out of their way to try to help you. It won't happen overnight but it will happen. Allow time for that. Spend that time making great things and being generous.
