One of my favorite things about cooking is how simple it is to integrate your senses into the process. Rarely in my modern life do I need to engage my sense of touch or smell but good cooking relies on both. The pasta is done when it has just the right texture when you chew it. The chicken is done when you smell it from the living room.

You can set timers for each of these while following a recipe but it won't be as good as if you'd followed your senses. Cooking is one great way to start to get back in touch with your body.
