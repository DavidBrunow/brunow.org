I'm starting to falter on my habits. I'm losing the motivation to continue to create every day. I've written something every day for 144 days and I feel like I'm starting to run out of things to say.

That's strange though because new things keep happening. That means I must have new things to talk about and that makes me think I'm getting tired or lazy.

This is the point where I push through and put one foot in front of the other. What I write might not be very good during this slog, but I'll get through it and to the other side. I know this is good for me and I have to force myself to do it even when most of me wants to stop.
