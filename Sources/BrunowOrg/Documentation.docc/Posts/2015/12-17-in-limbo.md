Yesterday I sent an email to a potential partner about a project we'd like to launch with them. We've put a few months of work into a prototype and we think it could be a Really Big Deal. If things go well then we have more work to do. If things go poorly then all our work to this point was for nothing.

For now, we are in limbo.
