Once again I didnâ€™t do a good job of keeping track of my daily learning in July, but like June it was all about WWDC.

I made it through another 30 or so videos and have 36 left to watch.

I've also recently spent time watching videos from previous years to learn more about Bluetooth for a new project I'm starting.
