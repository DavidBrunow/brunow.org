"They" separates. "We" unites.

Tonight an acquaintance at a party I went to made a comment while watching the opening to the Special Olympics, something to the effect of "they want to be called intellectually disabled." I don't agree.

We all want to be treated like we are humans that matter. We don't want to be labeled or put to the side. We are all the same, regardless of how smart we are or the color of our skin or any number of different things that we could look at and use to separate ourselves.
