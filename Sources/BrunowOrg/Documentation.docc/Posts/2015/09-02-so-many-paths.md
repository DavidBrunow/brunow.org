Life has so many paths with so many starting points and so many destinations. You started somewhere different than I and you want to end up somewhere different. Of course your path will be different than mine. Your path will be different than everyone else's.

Don't get caught up in the details of someone else's success. Their details probably won't help you. Try to figure out if the bigger pieces of their story make sense to you. If they resonate then try adopting them into your life. See how they work for you.

Don't blame yourself if they don't work for you. Some things will fit and others won't. Not fitting indicates a mismatch, not a flaw.

You're perfect the way you are.
