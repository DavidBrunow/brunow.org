Everything you do either reinforces your friends' and families' values or puts pressure on them to change them. For example, my friends apologize when they kill mosquitos because I've mentioned that I do my best not to kill living beings. I make sure to say that I am not hurt or insulted by their actions because my values only apply to myself, but they still feel some pressure.

I've felt the same pressure and I'm thankful for it. My sister has made me very conscious of water conservation and all she had to do was plant a seed and my mind did the rest. Now every time I run water I think about what she's said.

Start sharing the change you want to see in the world, without any pressure. Simply sharing it can be enough to make it spread.
