Tonight we walked the dog to a restaurant and ate dinner on the patio. Our dog is very friendly and whenever he spotted someone he would lock his eyes on them and start wiggling, hoping that she would come give him attention. It was the "weird ones" &mdash; people who looked a little different than everyone else &mdash; that walked right up and scratched his ears.

Social conventions don't allow for normal people to walk up to a complete stranger and pet their dog. I find that sad. Social conventions get in the way of us connecting with other living creatures even when we have only the best of intentions. Something about that doesn't seem right.
