Private First Class Cuming died on August 21, 2004 when an RPG hit the Humvee he was driving.

I did not know PFC Cuming well. He was in a different section of my unit &mdash; a truck driver and I was a mechanic, but I happened to eat breakfast with him on the morning of August 21. He was smiling, excited to go out on a mission. He smiled a lot.

Here's to you, PFC Cuming. You will never be forgotten.
