Another on my list of things that don't make sense and is unsustainable is the cost of healthcare.

I don't have a whole lot more to say about this topic &mdash; long ago I decided to opt out of the health care system. But things are way past ridiculous when an insured individual has to resort to crowdfunding to get their bills paid.

Drug companies and hospitals are leaches providing little benefit at an extraordinary financial cost. This can't continue forever.

I hope that we begin to see that we don't have to pay these costs. I hope we see that being healthy is natural if we live in natural ways. I hope we will work towards our health every day so we can upend the current system.
