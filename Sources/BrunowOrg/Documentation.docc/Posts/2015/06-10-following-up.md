If someone has to follow up with me on something that they've asked me or that I've promised to do, I feel as though I have failed. And one of the easiest ways to get under my skin is to say you are going to do something and then not follow through. I see this all the time in the professional world.

It seems so simple, but it is a great way to stand out. If I can give you something to do and be 100% confident that you will get it done or come to me with any issues without my follow up then you are on my very short list of people I want to work with.

The hardest time to follow up with someone is when delivering bad news, but that is the most important time to do it, not an excuse not to.
