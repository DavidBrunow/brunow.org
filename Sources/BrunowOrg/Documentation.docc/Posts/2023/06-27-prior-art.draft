Early in my software development journey I thought that being good meant
inventing new things. I felt like looking at similar solutions for the problem
I was working on was a form of cheating &mdash; copying from my neighbor on a
test. Wrapped up in that was a feeling like I wasn't smart if I needed to look
up the answer.
