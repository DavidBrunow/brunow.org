Sometimes it just isn't working. I was just writing a blog post and hit a point where I had nothing left to say. Many times I'll just cut it off and post it because abrupt endings are one of the things I do. But this wasn't good enough for that so I threw it out. 

I thought it was an interesting idea to write about but it wasn't. I could look at it as though I wasted time on that post but I don't. Looking at it that way isn't productive and can only bring me down. I look at it as part of the cost of writing. Dead ends and words you'll never share are just part of what it takes to keep writing.
