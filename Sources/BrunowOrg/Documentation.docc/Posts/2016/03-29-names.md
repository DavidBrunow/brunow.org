Names are important.

I got into a disagreement with someone the other day about company names. He said that only the company itself gets any value out of a name. I replied that the company's customers also get value out of that name. For example, when I go to buy an Apple product I want to know that what I'm getting is made by Apple. I buy their products because their name means quality to me and their values align with mine.

These names don't only matter for high end electronics, which are obviously discretionary purchases and not necessities. Names matter for every purchase we make and each name has a different meaning that might appeal to you. Certain names tell you "you won't find this for a lower price" while others say "we care about the world we live in."

Without a way to protect their names companies would be hurt a little, but I believe that consumers would be hurt much more.
