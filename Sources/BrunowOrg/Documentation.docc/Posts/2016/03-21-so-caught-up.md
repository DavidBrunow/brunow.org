Sometimes I get so caught up that I don't notice anything. I don't notice the warm, golden sun shining through the trees. I don't notice my body and the pain and stiffness I feel from sitting at my desk for hours mostly motionless. I'm stuck in my mind, in the problems I'm trying to solve in this moment, in another world separated from this one.

But then I notice and noticing is my escape. If I have the energy &mdash; and many times I do not &mdash; then noticing is the first step towards reuniting with the world around me. My senses awaken. Colors become more vibrant and textures more texture-y. I see the beauty inherent in the world again.
