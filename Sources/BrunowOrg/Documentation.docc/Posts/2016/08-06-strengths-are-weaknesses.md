And weaknesses are strengths. Each needs to fit in the right place at the right time.

My wide range of technical talents helps me to fit in many roles as part of a team, to solve problems across a variety of areas, and to have a better idea of the big picture of how all the technologies fit together.

Those same strengths turn to weaknesses if I need to perform a highly specialized task in one area or if the project requires extremely optimized performance.

Fortunately I've found the right spots for what I'm naturally good at. Building things for business clients generally plays tinny broad knowledge base.
