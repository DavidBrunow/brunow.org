Is your ego or the mission driving your action? Are you doing it because you want your name at the top or because you want to see this thing in the world?

When I'm working on a project I'm usually somewhere in the middle between mostly mission and a little ego or mostly ego and a little mission. These questions aren't meant to judge and your reasons for what you do are your own and don't matter to me. What matters is when your real reasons don't align with what you're telling yourself. If they don't align then you may not get where you want to be because you're heading the wrong way.
