I'm not good at saying no to people. Part of that is being in a position of needing to pay the bills. Part of that is the drive to complete the mission no matter the cost. Part of it is poor time management and believing that I can always squeeze another hour out of a day. But I think the biggest part is just that I have an image of myself that I have to keep up. That image is of a person who doesn't drop the ball or let other people down and letting go of that image without thinking I'm a bad person is tough.
