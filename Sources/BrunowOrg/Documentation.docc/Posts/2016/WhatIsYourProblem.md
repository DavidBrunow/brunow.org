One of the ideas behind the “blog every day” philosophy is that forcing yourself to ship something every day will make you better at shipping things. It will reinforce the pattern of releasing things into the world so you don’t get stuck in a cycle of fear and always trying to make it better.

Not being able to ship things isn’t my problem. If anything, I have the opposite problem. I’m an over-shipper or a premature-shipper. I have a strong drive to get things done and when that is combined with too many things to do I have to really fight the urge to ship it right away despite any flaws in it.

I bet the best solution to this problem is to not have too many things to do and to set the right pace for myself.
