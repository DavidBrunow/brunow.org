My word &mdash; doing what I say I'll do &mdash; is my most valuable possession. If I have to choose between feeding myself and keeping my word then I'll go hungry. I can't always keep my word &mdash; things happen &mdash; but every day I have the simple opportunity to keep my word by being where I say I'll be. If I RSVP that I'll attend, I'm there. If I say I'll be at a meeting then I'll be there. In some ways those little things are more important than the big &mdash; anyone can show up for one time when the stakes are high. The challenge is showing up every day when you think no one is watching.
