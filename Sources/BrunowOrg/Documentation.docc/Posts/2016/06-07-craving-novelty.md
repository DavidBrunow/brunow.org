Us folk in the technology world crave novelty. Technology is never moving fast enough and we always want the next next new thing. Tech companies and "journalists" take advantage of our wants and weekly or sometimes daily fan the flames with the latest press release disguised as news story.

Making an impact and creating powerful, impactful things is the opposite of chasing novelty. It requires dedication and focus and the willpower to avoid the distractions of the new thing.

As tech people it is important that we pay attention to the tech landscape and what is going on in general. But we need to make sure we don't get caught up in it.
