You are your likes and dislikes. Your opinions of what is good and bad. By taking on someone else's opinions as your own you lose yourself. Your unique voice is lost.

Not fitting in perfectly is scary. In some situations it is dangerous. But it is the path to finding yourself. It is the path to happiness.

I don't mean to say that you should disagree with everything. I mean that you should take time to consider your thoughts and feelings on a subject. And you should share your well considered thoughts and feelings. Don't shout them at people. Share them humbly in the intention of service.
