I've been on a social media diet over the last couple weeks. I got to a point where I felt I was spending too much time on it and decided I wanted that time back. I didn't want to find myself absent-mindedly scrolling through Instagram or taking every moment that I wasn't actively doing something and checking Twitter. And I'm not even going to get started on Facebook.

A few nights ago I didn't feel like sleeping so I laid down on the couch, put my headphones on, and listened to new music. I opened Twitter since I hadn't in a while and it looked different to me. It no longer felt like something I wanted to be a part of.

Of course that's boring and I don't blame you if you don't care about my opinion. But I wonder if my experience is that of the canary in the coal mine or if I'm simply the old man yelling at the clouds. Am I just a little ahead of the rest of the population with my increasing disgust towards social media or is my opinion irrelevant in the context of normal humans?
