### Problems with Involving the Old Guard in New Initiatives

* In their infancy, new initiatives are too small for the Old Guard to care about &mdash; a thousand dollars or a dozen people here or there aren't worth their time or money
* The Old Guard has their own regimented way of doing things and can't be nimble or agile in response to change
* The Old Guard will want to do things their way
* The Old Guard will want a prominent seat at the table due to their status, regardless of the resources they provide
* The Old Guard is less likely to see the vision of the future since their day to day is solving the problems of today and their experience is in solving the problems of the past

### Benefits of Involving the Old Guard

* Resources (money, people, connections)
* Some relevant experience that overlaps the problems in the new initiative
