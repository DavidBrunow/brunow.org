Listening to the same podcast as yesterday, but a different episode, a person mentioned something along the lines of "that is how we will solve the homelessness problem." But I don't think that homelessness is a solvable problem. You can make it better perhaps, but our world is currently setup in a way that knowingly puts some people out on the streets and is ok with that. The problem isn't the homeless it is that our society thinks it ok that some people don't have a consistent, safe place to shower, shit, and sleep.

In our current system, homelessness is not solvable. Despite the compassion I feel for those without homes, it's a problem I don't want to touch since I know I can't fix it.
