The best way to prove yourself valuable in business is to get important things done. The things that no one else can do. The things that are harder. If you're doing those things then you have the freedom to do what you please. But two burdens come with it: your peers will try to coast by while you work and you will have to find a way to say no so you aren't burnt out when everyone wants you to do everything.
