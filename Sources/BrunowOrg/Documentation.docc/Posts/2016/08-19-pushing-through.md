I'm nearing the end of a few projects right now and once again I'm reminded about how hard it is to finish something. It takes strong determination to make it all the way to 100% and not call it good enough. Fatigue sets in and every little task seems like a mountain to climb. Imagining being done and how nice that will be doesn't help, it only makes it harder to endure the difficulty. My only advice is to find a way to focus on the parts of the work that you enjoy and let go of the rest.
