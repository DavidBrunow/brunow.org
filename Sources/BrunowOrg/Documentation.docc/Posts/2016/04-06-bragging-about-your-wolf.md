I understand being proud of something and wanting to share that with the world. If you don't do this then the world will ignore your since they don't know the cool things you are doing.

I don't understand fluffing up what you are doing so that it seems better than it is. Continually exaggerating the impact or coolness of what you are doing will cause the same problem in the opposite way. The world will ignore your because they've grown tired of your hyperbole.

I speak softly because the people who matter the most are the ones that take the time to listen to me now. Shouting at them will drive them away.
