I've just started reading the book ["How to Fly a Horse"](https://itun.es/us/UkoO2.l) and although I've not gotten far what I have read has been mostly novel to me. One part that had a large impact on me was the author discussing what made us different than the other humans that didn't make it as long as we did &mdash; different species of Homo sapiens. He makes the case that it is our relentless innovation that made us the victor. Before us homo sapiens were happy to use the same tools through multiple generations, passing them down from father to son. But that wasn't good enough for us, we wanted to make our tools better and then better again.
