Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is next week and I'm excited about watching it. I'm not excited for any particular thing that's coming because I don't know what's coming. That surprise is helping to build my anticipation but more so I'm looking forward to the showmanship. In particular I'm looking forward to how the showmanship makes me feel. I'm looking forward to Apple leaders taking and commanding the stage and slowly revealing their story with perfect pacing building to new announcements. I'm looking forward to well-crafted videos that show great things being done with Apple products. I'm excited about the feeling that I'm part of something much bigger than me &mdash; the Apple developer community &mdash; and that we are all coming together for this one thing for this one week.

People, even cynical software developers like me, want to be wowed. We want to be part of something bigger than ourselves. We want someone to put the effort into showmanship for us.

Apple isn't magical &mdash; they just understand what people want. Another thing I'm looking forward to next week is absorbing more lessons on how they do it so I can do the same in the future.
