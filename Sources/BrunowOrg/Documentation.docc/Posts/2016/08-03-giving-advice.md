I'm not fond of giving advice. I think a person should live their life rather than my version of their life. I can't control someone else's happiness and even if I could I can't predict what would make them happy since my type of happiness will be different than theirs.

That being said, I do believe in sharing my opinion and experience. The difference is subtle. My opinion is what I would do in the situation and my experience is the reason why I would do that. That's different than advice which is me telling someone else what they should do.

By providing my experience and rationale for my opinion I can enable that other person to have one more data point to make their own decision. And since it is only my opinion I don't feel attached to the outcome in the same way as I would as if I were giving advice.
