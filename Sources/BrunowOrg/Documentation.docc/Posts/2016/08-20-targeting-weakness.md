I was watching Olympic volleyball today and during a timeout we got to overhear the coaches telling their players the strategy. The point that stuck out &mdash; even the announcers commented on it &mdash; was targeting the players in positions 5 and 6 on the serve. They hoped to take advantage of weakness.

This is a sound, logical strategy. Winning is important and targeting weakness increases your odds of winning. But I don't like it and I try not to do it.

I don't want to win by beating the worst players on the other team. I want to test myself against the best of them. That's a true victory to me.
