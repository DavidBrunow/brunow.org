If something is easy then it will be exploited until it is not useful. Lowering prices, paying for ads, spamming your social media or newsletter followers, and being louder are all easy things to do. Things you'll probably think "I should do this too, I mean why not it is free."

The underlying problem is the motivation behind these methods, which is looking for attention. Attention is one of our greatest and most limited resources and should be protected. Our motivation should be providing value for the people that will find us valuable. Real value, not "the same with different packaging" value.

Providing value is harder. You don't just pull a lever and ratchet up the value. But that's the point because you can make a competitive advantage out of it, something you can't do by lowering your price or paying for more ads.
