Many things in this world are scary and bad. Getting in a car accident, laid off, or cancer are all bad and scary things. But I have a hard time thinking of other realistic threats.

The other scary things are either neutral or good. Asking someone to be your friend is scary but good. Getting a big project to work on is scary but good. Letting your kid take a risk and be independent is scary but good.

Scary is not equal to bad. Most times you should move towards the scary rather than away from it.
