I've never had a plan for my life. As a kid I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grew up. I've never been able to plan where I'd be in five years. I've been affected by change outside my control enough to learn to not try. Fortunately I've been open to what life has presented me and that has led to a full, if unconventional, life.

If I'd had a plan (and been able to stick to it) I'd never have sold cars, gone to massage therapy school, joined the Army, or worked a number of roles in banking. I can't say my life would've been worse but it would've been very different. Despite all the stress and heartache I've been through I like where I'm at now. Looking back, I feel like I've liked where I was far more often than not. I don't think I can judge life in any better way.

Of course I still want some things to be different &mdash; I think that's a natural part of being human. It is the part that keeps moving us forward. But it's possible to be both happy in the now and want things to change. And fortunately things always change.
