Every bit of technology is only a tool to do accomplish a goal. These tools excel in the situations for which they were designed and may possibly work in other situations, with the right amount of ingenuity. 

It is better to know the right tool rather than always falling back on your sledgehammer. The sledgehammer can do many things but it is heavy, slow, and impossible for some people to use.
