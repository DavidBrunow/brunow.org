It is tempting and easy to see how someone else got to where they are and want to imitate it. One problem with this is that you never know exactly how they got there &mdash; what you see and even what they tell you isn't the whole story. Another problem is that their success came in their time &mdash; six months or six years ago when they were where you are.

It is important to notice what others are doing and you can use that knowledge to help inform your decisions. But blindly copying what they are doing, or even what the entire industry is doing, won't get you where you want to be given your resources and timing.
