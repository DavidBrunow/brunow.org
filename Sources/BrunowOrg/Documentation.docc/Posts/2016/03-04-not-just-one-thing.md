It's never just one thing. Success doesn't come by following one simple rule and failure isn't caused by a single weak link. We form opinions after our brains compile a slew of factors into a composite picture.

We hear about the success and don't see the hard work. We try to take control of failure by blaming one person or factor. We think we like a restaurant for one reason and don't notice the dozen other factors.

Don't focus on one thing. Focus on systems and how it all fits together.
