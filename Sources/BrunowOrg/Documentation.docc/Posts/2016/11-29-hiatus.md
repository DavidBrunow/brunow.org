Taking unintended breaks.

I stopped writing for a while. I'd been writing a blog post every day for over a year and then simply stopped one day. I was stressed and tired  from working almost constantly and then the app that I made for writing broke. I didn't have time to fix it and I really didn't have time to write.

I'm glad I stopped. I didn't need another thing weighing on my mind and taking my time. I didn't like breaking my streak but streaks come and go like everything else.

During the break I kept getting urges to write. I'm glad I got that affirmation that tells me I'm doing this because I want to, not because of a streak or because I think I need to write. I want to write.
