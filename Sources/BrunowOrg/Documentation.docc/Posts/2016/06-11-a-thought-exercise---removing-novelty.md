What would your life look like if you removed everything new for a little while, maybe two weeks? Looking at my life, I'd have to cut out social media, news, blogs, media I haven't seen or heard before, learning new things, and meeting new people. Would cutting out those things make my life better or worse? Would it be nice to take a break from novelty every now and then, maybe on the weekends? 

What do you think? Does the idea of missing out on novelty make you cringe or sound like a relief?
