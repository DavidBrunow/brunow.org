We all do it. We all tell ourselves stories that are a little more dramatic and a little more favorable or unfavorable than reality towards the main character in our lives &mdash; ourself. People are targeting us specifically in some bad way or fortune is shining on us as everything goes our way. We may just embellish a little bit, crafting a story about how we aren't meant to do the thing that is hard for us to do.

They are all stories. They are all lies we tell ourselves. And that's ok. But it's better if you notice those lies. Once you notice them you can use them for your benefit.
