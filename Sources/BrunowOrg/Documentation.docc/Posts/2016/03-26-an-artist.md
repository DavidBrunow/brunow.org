What is an artist?

I think I have a simple definition &mdash; someone who shares what is inside of herself. What is inside of her could be the way she sees the world or the way she feels in a moment of grief or the rage she feels because she's been mistreated and looked down upon her entire life. I can't define what's inside of her, it could be anything.

If you share what is inside you then you are an artist.

Art is not inherently complicated or high brow. Art is a piece of an artist that she's been generous enough to share.
