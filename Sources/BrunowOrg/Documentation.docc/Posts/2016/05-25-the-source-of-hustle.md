Where does hustle come from? Is it forged from hard times where you can barely feed yourself? Or is it something inherent inside us that we can choose? Or is it a survival instinct that the strongest of us have?

I have grand ideas about helping people never have to suffer through wondering where their next meals will come from or how they'll pay for a roof over their heads. But would that rob them of the opportunity to do something great? Or would it allow them to do something greater since they aren't wasting energy worrying about survival?
