I was showing a friend the iPad Pro and Apple Pencil a couple of nights ago. For the demonstration I just opened the Notes app, handed him the Pencil, and let him go. He got to decide what he wanted to try &mdash; he chose how the product revealed itself to him. I could have walked him through all the features but then he would miss out on discovering the magic himself. Plus, features I like may not matter to him because he may not be able to picture himself using it the same way I would.

When introducing someone to a product it is best to do as little as possible and let them connect the dots.
