I listened to a podcast this evening that stated that our number four need, after food, water, and safety, is social. We need people and therefore we're highly motivated to be social creatures.

As someone on the less-social end of the spectrum I find this fascinating but wonder if it applies to everyone equally or if our desire for social interaction is directly related to this need.
