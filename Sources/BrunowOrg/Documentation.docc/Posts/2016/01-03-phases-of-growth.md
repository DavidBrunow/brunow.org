I like to think of the growth of our company on the way trees grow. Trees grow up some, then out some, then up some more. During adverse conditions, when it is too cold or too dry, they stop growing upwards and set themselves up for future growth. The strongest trees are those that grow the slowest.

Comparing our companies growth to a large tree helps me find patience when I feel things are moving too slowly. It helps me to think about where we are going and what our next steps are when I get frustrated.
