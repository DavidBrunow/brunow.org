A year ago tomorrow I decided to start writing a blog post every day. It started as a seven day challenge which has, with this post, turned into a year. I'm not stopping here, just recording a milestone.

One of my reasons for starting this habit was to get better at communicating through writing. I think I've improved but it is difficult to judge from inside my head. I don't think I've gotten closer to finding my voice but I still find myself writing and choosing topics like the writers I admire.

Writing every day has forced me to think through topics in much more detail than if they were only floating in my head. That alone is worth writing every day, even if I weren't sharing it.
