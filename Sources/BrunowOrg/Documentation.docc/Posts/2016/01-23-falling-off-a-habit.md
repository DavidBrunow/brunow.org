Falling off a habit is like falling off a bike while learning to ride. You have a choice to get back on and keep trying or to say "this isn't for me." That's your choice, not some foregone conclusion based upon who you are and what you are or aren't good at.

If you get no good out of the habit, and you can see far enough into the future that you know it will never be useful, then stop falling off and move on. Otherwise, get back on. Don't make a big deal of it, just brush yourself off and try again.
