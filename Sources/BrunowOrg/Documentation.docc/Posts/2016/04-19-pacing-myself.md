Last Friday I started a project with a silly short timeline &mdash; building an iOS app in 2 weeks. I estimated the project at around 100 hours so that means near continuous work on it over this short time frame. I've handled similar situations before but I'm approaching this time differently.

In the past when faced with this situation I'd work until I could anymore, get as little rest as possible, and then get back to work again. I'd lost both sleep and motion because I'd rarely leave my desk.

This time I'm doing my best to still get good, consistent sleep and to exercise regularly. Instead of cutting these out I've cut most other entertainment activities. I'm not drinking or going out and I'm watching very little television.

I'm hoping by the end of these two weeks I'll be a little healthier than when I started rather than being the empty shell of a person that I usually am.
