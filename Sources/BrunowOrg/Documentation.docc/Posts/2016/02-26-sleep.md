A month ago I was getting good sleep &mdash; at least 8 hours a night &mdash; and I felt great. It had been a while since I'd gotten that much sleep and before that is forgotten how lack of sleep changes me. I'd been sleep deprived for so long that it became the norm.

Now I'm back to being sleep deprived because it has been a very busy month. Well, that and because for me sleep is the thing that gives rather than any other activities. It is amazing to be able to remember the clarity and creativity I had a month ago. I would sit down in the morning to write this blog post and something would come to me almost immediately. Now I struggle to come up with an idea and I can feel that my writing is worse.
