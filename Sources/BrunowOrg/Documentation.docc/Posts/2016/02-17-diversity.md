I think every organization, no matter how small, needs a plan for diversity. That plan is especially important in community organizations and non-profits made up of volunteers because those organizations should be welcoming to the entire community. Leadership that all looks the same doesn't look welcoming to me, even if I fit in.

Yes, diversity goes beyond gender or skin color. But no, that isn't a valid excuse not to find other genders and skin colors to join the leadership. Which brings me to another point &mdash; saying "no one applied to the job that will help us with diversity" is not an excuse. Find people different than you and recruit them.
