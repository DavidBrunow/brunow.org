Doesn't just come from people who don't like what you're doing or how you're doing it. The worst pressure is from the people who praise what you're doing but add "have you tried XXX?" You want to please them because they like you. And maybe they're right &mdash; you're no expert and good fortune is the main reason you are where you are.
