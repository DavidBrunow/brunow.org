We've had a rough couple months. I've been in the fun situation of simultaneously being grossly overworked and overdrawing my bank account. The novelty of owning our own business has worn off and now we're only continuing through sheer willpower.

It feels like we're between waves in the ocean right now. We've overcome a good amount by surviving for a year. But we still can't see land &mdash; just a wall of water.

Hopefully land is just the other side of it.
