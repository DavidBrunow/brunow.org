Much of my dissatisfaction in life comes from unreasonable expectations which should be fairly easy to solve by just altering my expectations. The problem is that I can't figure out if my expectations are too high or if I just need to keep pushing in order to make my expectations reality.

Take estimating time as an example. I go through a lot of stress over meeting timelines that I promised to clients because I try to be true to my word. But estimating time on a project of any complexity is nearly impossible. Should I come to terms with that reality in order to try to spare myself some stress? Or should I keep on the path I'm on now and let my dissatisfaction power me through to a solution? I'm leaning towards the latter but that might just be because I'm stubborn and don't want to accept reality.
