Thinking about the way our technology has advanced over time I think it is safe to say that it moves towards smaller and more convenient until that point where smaller is no longer more convenient. A toaster can only get so small before your bread no longer fits. A knife can only get so small before you can't hold it anymore.

If trying to predict the future of technologies it is a pretty sure bet that they'll get smaller. The question is what is the usable limit of that piece of technology.
