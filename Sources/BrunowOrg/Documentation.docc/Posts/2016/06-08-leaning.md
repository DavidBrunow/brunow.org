I lean a lot. While making coffee the morning I caught myself leaning my hips against the sink. Right now I'm leaning over the dining table while writing this. Later today I'll relax on the couch and lean back.

I lean too much. Leaning means I can't support my mass and that I need help. Occasional help is fun but spending my day moving between different things to lean on is not.
