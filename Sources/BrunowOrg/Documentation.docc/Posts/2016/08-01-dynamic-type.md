Apple has a tool for developers called Dynamic Type. What this tool does is allow developers to use text that can be resized by the user so that it can be adjusted by someone who can't see well.

I really want to use this tool and jumped on it in one project before realizing that it was too difficult for me to do. The difficulty came from trying to get the user interface right for every combination of device and text size. I never found a solution and then gave up at that time to get the project done.

Maybe I'm missing something or maybe I'm taking Apple's advice to use Dynamic Type to literally. Maybe they mean where it makes sense. Or perhaps there is a third option where the user interface needs to be rearranged to support Dynamic Type and I need to approach the problem with different designs.
