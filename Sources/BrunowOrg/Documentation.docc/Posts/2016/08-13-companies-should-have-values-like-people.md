I couldn't agree with [Tim Cook more](http://www.fastcompany.com/3062595/tim-cooks-apple/tim-cook-on-why-apple-still-matters). I'm starting to learn more about each company I buy from so I know that I'm supporting companies with similar values. Is this the way of the future or am I just getting old and cantankerous?
