One way you may try to figure out what is good is to look around at things you like &mdash; things you think are good. Maybe you can use those things to set your bar for quality. But imitation isn't enough &mdash; a copy of something good isn't necessarily good. Rather than simply copying you have to know what things about that good thing make it good. What do you like about it? What if you changed this one part, would you still like it then?
