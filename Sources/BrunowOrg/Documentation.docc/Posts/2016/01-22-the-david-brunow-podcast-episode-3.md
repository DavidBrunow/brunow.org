Howdy!

On the [third episode of The David Brunow Podcast](https://brunow.org/podcast/) I’m getting back on the horse after falling off a year ago, and this time I’m going to take things easier. I have a new, relaxed attitude towards creating my podcast and I’m drinking a scotch, neat.

On this episode I talked about the book and music publishing industries and wondered if the software industry will follow a similar path. I also talked about a new to-do system that I’m trying out.
