You have more control over the pace of your work and life than you think. As social animals we tend to subconsciously behave like our peers &mdash; the people around us. One of these behaviors is our speed. When walking together we naturally match each other's pace and if you move more quickly the person with you will probably speed up without thinking about it. Similarly they'll slow down when you do.

It is similar to something I learned while doing dog agility years ago. If you are running with your dog and begin to slow down then she will too because she's taking your cue. If you want her to continue at full speed then you need to do the same.

What cues are you putting out? What pace are you setting?
