I don't like feeling bad. Like when you feel you aren't doing your best or you think you're letting someone down. Not great feelings.

I want to run away from those feelings. I want to get out of whatever situation I'm in that I think is to blame. Maybe sometimes that is the right answer.

I don't think it usually is. Most of the time I just need to notice the way I feel, acknowledge it, and keep going. Stay on the same course and wait to make decisions about changes.
