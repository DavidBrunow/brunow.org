I'm getting to a place where I don't care about being patient with certain behaviors. I'm not sure what all those behaviors are yet. I'm not sure what the "right" limits for my patience are either. The problem I'm finding is that certain personality types take advantage of that patience and keep pushing its limits. I think I need to treat those people differently and set firm limits.
