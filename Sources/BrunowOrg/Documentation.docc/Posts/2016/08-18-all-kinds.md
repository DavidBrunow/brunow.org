Like everything else in this world there are all kinds of business plans. You may want to think that everyone knows that good customer service and doing things the right way is good for business. But not everyone does. People build businesses around the worst parts of human behavior, taking advantage of our faulty wiring. Some make their profits by lying to their customers and only giving them what they've promised after forcing them to jump through ridiculous hoops.

I don't like it but it's out there. All I can do to counteract it is to build the best business I can following what I know to be right.
