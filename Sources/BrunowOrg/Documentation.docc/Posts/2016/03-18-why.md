Why do you do what you do? At this very moment, why are you reading this? What do you hope to get out of it? Will it bring you closer to what you want? To who you want to be?

I feel that why is a question we don't ask ourselves enough. We go through our days trained to avoid questions, told that we just need to do our jobs. That the answers to our questions come from someone above our pay grade.

That's bullshit.

Ask why.
