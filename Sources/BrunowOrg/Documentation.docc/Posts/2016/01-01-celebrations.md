Every day cannot be a celebration without losing the meaning behind it. Yet I find myself consistently trying to make my days more than they are. Maybe to fend off boredom, but probably due to overstimulation. When I'm surrounded by novelty and news I tend to try to make my days more exciting than they naturally are.

We need those slow days, just like we need our celebrations. Figuring out the right balance is the hard part.
