I feel that many people see the world as an untapped market for technology. That so many problems could be solved if we just had the right technical solution. So much money could be made with the right idea.

But it isn't the technology that matters. Building a successful software company is more about building a company and less about the software. Finding ways to solve problems is more about the people affected and less about the technology.

The technology isn't the key. It is a valuable part of your toolset.
