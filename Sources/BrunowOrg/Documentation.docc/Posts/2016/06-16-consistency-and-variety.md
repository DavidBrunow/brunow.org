We need them both. All consistency is boring and life passes us by. All variety and we're worn out and can't enjoy anything. There's a middle ground &mdash; a different one for you than I &mdash; that we need to find where we have certain things that are consistent. Those are our roots in the ground. The ground may shift but it does so slowly, as we age and everyone around us does. But our branches experience variety all the time as the winds blow them around. We need them both.
