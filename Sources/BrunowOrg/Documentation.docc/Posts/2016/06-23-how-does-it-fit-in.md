When creating something new you need to know where it will go in people's lives. Will it be something they use first thing in the morning? When they're on their morning commute? Before each meal? How will what you're creating fit into what they already do? Their life is probably overcrowded so you need to find a way to displace something else, find a way to save them time, or create such a good story for the value of your creation that they'll find a place to put it.

This is one of the places that people get the most deluded. They think that what they are making will fit into people's lives easily but that generally isn't the case. This is one of the areas you really need to look at objectively and with fresh eyes.
