If you're doing things right you'll see the world a little bit differently today than you did yesterday. Something you've exposed yourself to for a while will snap into focus and make sense. Or you'll encounter something new that feels fuzzy and undefined. The same things happened a week, a month, and a year ago to shape who you are today. A different you than you were.
