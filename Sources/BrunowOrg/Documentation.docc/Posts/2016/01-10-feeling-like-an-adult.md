I don't remember the first time I felt like an adult. I remember multiple times that I had responsibility for pretty big things &mdash; things that felt bigger than me. I would stop and think about them for a second and marvel at being a grown up.

Last night felt different. I had a moment while driving to the ER because my daughter had a seizure. What I wanted in that moment was someone to tell me "it is all going to be alright." But no one can tell me that. It isn't all going to be alright. And to me that is being adult &mdash; knowing that you have no reassurances and that no one can protect you.

We had a long night but by early this morning my daughter was a drugged up and tired version of her normal self, asking for hugs and everyone to play songs for her on the piano.
