I've played the game Chameleon Run on the Apple TV the last couple of days. It is a side scrolling running game where you have to make your player jump and change color depending on the terrain of the level. Some of the levels require quick responses and proper timing to navigate between obstacles.

I'm amazed by how quickly the human brain is able to learn to navigate the levels. Within minutes we can go from failing miserably every time we try to easily meeting all the objectives. This game is a great way of seeing how quickly we can learn and it's also a lot of fun.
