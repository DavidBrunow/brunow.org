It is easy to see what's wrong. That ability comes and almost visceral level &mdash; something feels wrong or you feel in your gut. The hard part is seeing how to fix it. That's also the valuable part because another person pointing out other thing that's wrong doesn't do much to solve the problem.

Having the vision to solve the problem takes more effort than seeing the problem. It takes thought, acknowledgement of your biases, and the ability to see points of view other than your own.
