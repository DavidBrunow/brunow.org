A good façade must be thick enough to mask what lies beneath it. It adds bulk and in my mind unnecessary weight. A bad façade barely hides what is below it and causes a feeling of disease in the minds of those who see it as they try to tie the inside and outside together.

Not using a façade only works if what is inside is what you want to show the world.
