A few weeks back I was recording a podcast and I didn't know what I was going to say going into it. I followed my normal podcasting routine &mdash; I poured myself a Scotch, sat down in the den, and started recording. I went through my usually intro. Then I sat there, not saying anything, for minutes. About thirty seconds in ideas started coming into my mind but I sat frozen not wanting to break the silence. I couldn't force myself to do it. I had to restart the recording before I could say anything.

A similar thing happened this morning with this blog post. Twice I sat down to figure out what to write and twice I failed to have something to say, until I put the pencil to the paper and words flowed.
