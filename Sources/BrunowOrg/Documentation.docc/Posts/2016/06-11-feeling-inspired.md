Most days I don't feel inspired to write a blog post. Instead I just sit at the dining table until a good-enough idea falls out of my head that I can write about. If I waited for inspiration before writing I'd write once a month or so &mdash; but realistically I wouldn't write at all since I wouldn't be in the habit and the friction of getting started would be enough to stop me.

The same idea applies to work, exercise, podcasting, and everything else you want or have to do in life. If you want to do it regularly you need to build a habit rather than waiting for inspiration.
