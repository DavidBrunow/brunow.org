A year ago, my daughter started [seizing in the back seat of my car][linkSz].

Since that day she drinks a syrupy medicine twice a day and I carry a shot of
Diazepam with me wherever we go. If she starts seizing again, I've been
instructed to call 911 and watch the clock. If she seizes for five minutes then
I inject the Diazepam in her rear.

Fortunately, she hasn't started seizing again. From what I see, the seizure has
had no adverse effect on her. Obviously, it is not possible to know what she
would be like if she hadn't had the seizure &mdash; but her curiosity and awareness
of the world grows daily. She teaches me children's songs and I teach her
Beatles songs.

The past year hasn't been about major breakthroughs &mdash; its about hundreds of
incremental improvements. I am happy to say that Emma is really becoming
herself. Now she is three and we can start to see her personality &mdash; hints of
who she will be.

Emma started school a few months ago and has picked up some wonderful bad habits
from the other kids. My favorite is when she doesn't get her way and starts fake
crying &mdash; the crying lasts for about five seconds and then she puts both hands
on her nose, whinily saying "Nose". I'll have to get some video of it.

The part of that that really makes me happy is that she wants to get her way.
That means something to me &mdash; that means that she knows what is going on
around her.

I'll share another thing she loves. I'm not a big fan of singing songs in the
traditional manner every single time, that gets boring. So I'll change the tempo
of a song like "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" when I sing it with Emma --
changing it from "Twin-kle Twin-kle, Lit-tle Star" to "Tweeeeeeeeeeenkle, 
Tweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeenkle, Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit-tle Staaaaaaaaar". She
absolutely adores it. Every time she sees me she grabs my mouth and starts
singing it that way to me. She is also very quick to adapt. If I change the
tempo in a different way then she will do the same.

These incremental improvements don't lend themselves to my concept for [her site][linkEC].
My intention there was always to show the major milestones and the big ways that
she overcomes expectations. Because of that, I haven't posted anything about her
progress in a long time. I fear that may make anyone who has heard her story
think she isn't making progress or that she hasn't recovered from her seizure.

So going forward, in addition to the major milestones, I will be doing "State of
the Emma" posts there, to share all the little things that turn into something
big when put together. I hope to have one out soon.

Thank you for caring about Emma.
