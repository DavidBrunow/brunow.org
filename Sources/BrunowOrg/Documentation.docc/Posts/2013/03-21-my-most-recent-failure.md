I don't fail often. Maybe I don't try things that stretch my limits. Maybe I just have high limits.

But recently I failed. I didn't get what I wanted and it hurt. The *what the hell am I doing with my life* kind of hurt.

I think I learned something from it, and since I can't very well share my pain, I'll share this: **the way you define yourself directly affects your happiness**. 

So if you define yourself as a software engineer, but you aren't very good at memory management or pointers confuse you or those sorts of things just bore you, then you shouldn't define yourself that way.[^1]

So how do I define myself now? I'm a guy that is good at making useful things. If I have to copy code that I don't fully understand right at this moment to create something useful right now, then that is what I'm going to do.

And defining myself that way, I set myself up for success.

[^1]: Not being a software engineer doesn't mean that you can't create great software. Really, it can help you make better software.
