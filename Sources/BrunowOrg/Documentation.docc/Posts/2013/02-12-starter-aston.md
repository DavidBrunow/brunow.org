I've spent the last few days driving the latest Ford Fusion. In case you haven't noticed them yet, they are gorgeous now. This picture shows a great angle of the car, although I find just about every angle of the front stunning.

The car is amazing to drive. It feels a lot like a BMW, from the suspension control to the steering feel to the steering wheel and other controls inside. The front wheel drive is the only clue from the driving dynamics that tells me it is a Ford.

Power is good out of the 1.6 litre turbo &mdash; it would be excellent with a manual transmission. Torque steer is noticeable, but the suspension handles turns under power very well.

I'd be surprised if this isn't my next car.
