You really should subscribe to [Rdio][linkRdio]. I cannot recommend the service enough, and I genuinely believe that it has made my life better.

But maybe you don't subscribe to Rdio. Perhaps you already have a huge music collection and don't like the new stuff that the kids these days are into. Or maybe you only listen to The Beatles and other artists whose music is owned by people who have an interest in holding back technology. 

But obviously you really love [Jenni Leder's][linkJenni] design of [Wake Up, Powered by Rdio][linkWakeUpRdio].

And since that's the case, you will want our new app, [Wake Up to Music][linkWakeUpMusic]. All the same functionality but powered by the music collection you have on your iPhone or iPod touch. 

[$1.99 in the App Store now][linkAppStore].
