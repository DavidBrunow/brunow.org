David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth. You might have something in common with him &mdash; if you think it is ridiculous that he is talking about himself in the first person here, so does he.

This is a general topic kind of blog where I share things that are going through my head. Many of the posts are from a period in my life where I was writing a blog post every day and many of those posts are not interesting. Many others I would disagree with today, I suppose that is possibly an indicator of growth (or maybe just being wrong a lot).

In the past I've generated this site with a static site generator called Magneto. Recently I've moved to using Apple's DocC static site generator instead. DocC was not created for this purpose, it was created for code documentation (that's why it says "Language: Swift" in the top trailing corner), but I was looking for a new way to host my blog and also wanted to get some experience using DocC, so here we are.
