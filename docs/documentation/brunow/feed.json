My thought is that mornings are for doing things — for action. Shortly after you get up will be when your mind and body are least tired and they should perform at their best. My plan is to not waste that energy on consuming information or relaxing physical activity like deep stretches. Those can wait until the evening when my energy is spent.</p><p>I don’t know how long this routine will stick.

It didn’t hurt that I’d set the alarm to allow 9 hours of sleep, but a week ago I would have slept the full time.</p><p>I’ve been concentrating on getting enough sleep for only 5 days. This week my average number of hours of sleep is 8.5 while I’ve had many weeks in the past averaging under 7.</p><p>The biggest difference that I’ve noticed is that I feel sleepy more often. I don’t know if I forgot what sleepy felt like or whether getting a small number of hours of sleep puts your body into a fight-or-flight mode that doesn’t let sleepy through or ignores your circadian rhythm. But after getting a few days of good sleep I could feel bedtime approaching in a way I didn’t before.</p><p>It could also be that I’ve changed some habits. I’m trying to pace myself on work and not stare at my computer screen late into the evening. I’m limiting TV time and spending the last 30 minutes of my night on the couch under a blanket and reading.</p><p>I’ve also given myself permission to be tired and to sleep, which may be the biggest factor in the way I feel.

If you can adapt to your environment faster than anyone else then you have the opportunity to get a disproportionate share of the benefits. For example, companies that were setup in such a way that they were able to make a quality app when Apple first introduced the App Store were able to benefit more than people getting into making apps after there were over a million apps in the App Store.</p><p>I think there are two key components to ensuring you’ll be flexible.</p><p>First, you have to give yourself slack in your schedule. If you are working at 100% of your capacity then you have no flexibility to add something new. It also helps to have projects which you can deprioritize as business demands shift to something else. For example, we are working on a couple of internal apps that we think will be great but have no set timeline for completion.</p><p>Second, you have to ensure your tools are always sharp. That can mean many things, but the essence of it is that if you need to do something right now to capitalize on an opportunity then you can’t spend days or weeks getting yourself ready. I’ll share an example.</p><p>I have an alarm clock app in the App Store. Before the music streaming service Rdio shut down, it was the only alarm clock that would allow you to wake up to your Rdio playlists (now it uses Apple Music instead.) I first created the app a few years ago before Apple released two devices with drastically different screen sizes. When they did that I didn’t have time to update the app to work on the new devices. Then about 6 months ago Rdio changed something that required my app to act differently. Since the app hadn’t been updated for the new phones I had to do a lot more work to fix that problem before I could fix the issue that Rdio caused. The outcome was that I didn’t hit Rdio’s deadline and had to pull the app from the store while I worked on it.</p><p>Don’t be that me that lets my apps get too out of date to remain flexible. Find any ways that you can remain as flexible as possible. You have no way of knowing the future on even the next project you’ll work on. Accept that reality and plan for it.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2016-01-07T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/01-08-my-mac-setup", "title": "My Mac Setup", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/01-08-my-mac-setup", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Every time I get a new Mac, or set one up for someone else, I make some tweaks that I think Apple should include by default.

When we started out all our previous work was confidential and we couldn’t include it in our portfolio so to an outsider that didn’t talk to us it looked like we had no experience. But again, go into this expecting that you will never get any money from that person. And I’d recommend doing something for a charitable organization — it will help you feel better about not getting paid.</p></p></li><li><p><p>You aren’t doing anything else — If you are starting a business and still building a client list then you’ll probably have a lot of downtime for the first six months. Doing something for free can be seen as a marketing expense. What can you do that people will see and say “I want to work with those folks!”? We’re building products that we own and providing them to people and organizations we like and hoping it will turn into something more. The best part of this strategy is that we own it still and can use it in other ways in the future.</p><p>The other benefit is that having this project helps to keep up your momentum. As a small business just starting out it is easy to get slowed down by details and getting your name out there while your motivation grinds to a halt. Having a project with a goal, even if it is for free right now, keeps you going stronger during the slow times.</p></p></li><li><p><p>You want to give back — If your version of volunteering is giving away your work for free then I think that’s great.</p></p></li></ul><p>Looking back over these scenarios, three out of four of them only apply to people getting started in business. If that is all the work you’ve gotten in your first year then I’d be worried about your business.</p><p>But I also believe that everything you give will come back to you in some way — I’m a hippy like that. If you don’t believe that then giving away anything for free might cause you more cognitive dissidence than any of the benefits are worth. You’ll be mentally kicking yourself for doing it, which isn’t where you want to be.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/01-10-feeling-like-an-adult", "title": "Feeling Like An Adult", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/01-10-feeling-like-an-adult", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I don’t remember the first time I felt like an adult.

And when I hear someone saying the same thing about a topic as I’ve heard elsewhere I don’t question their originality — instead I add their voice to any others I’ve heard with a similar viewpoint.

I’ve been posting on my blog irregularly but those postings haven’t been enough for me to “find my voice”. I either feel like I am a stuffy, boring version of myself or like I am imitating writers I admire.</p><p>I’ve also just started my path towards podcasting and after only a few minutes of trying to record myself without stumbling I am very humbled. Listening to great podcasts makes it all seem so natural.</p><p>I think it’s great that I’ve found things that I am not good at and that I feel very uncomfortable with both. I have a lot of room to grow.</p><p>I will only get better by doing them often. I’ll start with writing — I’m going to <a href='http://yourturnchallenge.strikingly.com/' title='take the challenge'>take the challenge</a> and ship for 7 days straight. I really think that in the long term every day may be too often to have a blog post since I tend to skip over the long daily blog posts that I subscribe to, but for a week it will be good.</p><p>After that challenge I’ll work on podcasting. Maybe just by recording my thoughts about something every day at first but at some point I need to ship that too.</p><p>While writing this I’ve asked myself “why do you want to be better at these two things.” I hadn’t asked myself that question before writing this so there is my first reason. Trying to communicate an idea to someone else makes you question it in ways that you don’t usually do in your internal mental dialog and both of these mediums stimulate those questions.</p><p>The second reason is that we have very limited ways of transferring information from one to another and I want to get better at all of them. I believe that our biggest limitation as a species is the difficulties we face transferring complex knowledge and I hope to find better ways of doing it.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/01-17-real-bad-people", "title": "Real Bad People", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/01-17-real-bad-people", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’ve watched two movies recently, The Revenant and The Iron Giant, that feature bad people doing bad things. This is typical in movies — the audience wants someone to cheer against as much as they want someone to cheer for. In both of these movies it is easy for the audience to cheer against the bad guy without remorse.</p><p>The problem is that real bad people in real life aren’t only bad. They are human like the rest of us, a mixture of good and bad and neutral. But most of our movies don’t include those nuances in their characters and I think it is because moviemakers want to make it easier on their audience. The feeling of internal conflict isn’t comfortable and if you feel sympathy for the bad guy then you’ll get that feeling.</p><p>The problem is that movies influence our real lives. We start to make the real life bad guys into the movie bad guys which makes it easier to be angry and hateful to them. This anger and hate leads to conflict and killing.</p><p>Avoiding the nuances of real bad guys may be fine for The Iron Giant since it is a kids movie. Of course it may be worse as we shape young minds to believe that real life is clear cut.

I don’t like the idea of jamming a giant spike in the back of my head, but I do think that directly connecting with the brain for VR makes more sense than trying to go through the eyes. The eyes can only process a relatively small amount of data at once and VR that shows images ignores the other senses which are just as vital as sight to a sense of reality. The main reason I want to see this technology is for learning. Like in The Matrix, I think our brains could learn much more quickly without our sensory organs slowing it down.</p><p>The second technology is a non-intrusive, always-wearable device for monitoring brain activity at the synapse level. This device, which I image would fit around the head like a headband, would monitor the electrical signals moving through the brain. The main reason I want to see this technology is because my daughter has seizures and we don’t know why. We don’t have any way of knowing when a seizure will occur or what will trigger it and constant monitoring could help with this. Also, I see it helping people that don’t suffer from epilepsy because they could see what parts of their brain are active and react accordingly. If all the stress centers are firing then seeing that might be enough to push a person to change their lifestyle.</p><p>I don’t know how practical either of these technologies are and I doubt I could have any role in bringing them to reality. Maybe life will guide me in the direction where I get to see if I can.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/01-19-continual-forward-progress", "title": "Continual Forward Progress", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/01-19-continual-forward-progress", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I think I’ve written about this subject before but it is worth repeating.

I got tired of people telling me I should play basketball so I tried out for the team. Before that I had played in my friend’s driveway a few nights a week but until I made the team I didn’t know just how awful I was at the sport.</p><p>It took me weeks to be able to make a layup. For people unfamiliar with basketball lingo, a layup is a move where you dribble the ball while running towards the basket and then jump off one foot while moving the ball towards the basket with the opposite hand and gently throwing the ball into the basket. It is the most fundamental basketball move and I could not do it. Every day in practice while the team was working together I would repeatedly try to make a layup.</p><p>Many other things seem to have come easily to me in life. When I was in the Army I was easily able to get physically fit and rank at the top of my class. And shooting a rifle in a straight line was simple as well, other than some small issues with the foxholes not being deep enough and my helmet pushing my glasses off my face.</p><p>Computers and technology have always been a strength as well. In two months I went from having never written a real program to having a fully functional app in the App Store.</p><p>It is so easy for me to look back at these things I’ve described and know I’m good at them and only remember that I’ve always been good at them. It is so easy to forget that initial struggle and to forget all the hard work — all the layups that I missed. It is so easy for anyone to say “I’m not good at this” and just quit.</p><p>I don’t remember everything I’ve ever started and failed, I remember the ones that I’ve stuck with. I remember the things that I’ve spent hours or years improving — so slowly that looking back it seems like it was always there. I got my first computer when I was 13 and became a programmer at 30. I missed a lot of layups.</p><p>Now I look forward to doing a lot of shitty writing and recording a lot of boring podcasts and then finding the next thing that makes me uncomfortable and amateur.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/01-20-it-will-take-care-of-itself", "title": "It Will Take Care Of Itself", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/01-20-it-will-take-care-of-itself", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’ve often said to myself “it doesn’t matter” to try to relax about something weighing on my mind, but that isn’t right.

I left there about 4 years ago and yet one of the programs they were implementing while I was still there is still in place — in essence, it is a debit card rewards program. My initial thought was that they are treating a tactic as a strategy and lacking any real strategy. That may be true but seeing as how I’m not part of the day to day operations it would be arrogant of me to make that assumption. But I do think it is a fun exercise to think about if I remove it from this context and think about banking generically.</p><p>I don’t know much about the state of banking today. I have done no research on the subject in years and don’t really care. But I do know my own preferences, which I can use to define at least a small segment of the market. The question is whether that segment is a sign of things to come or just an anomaly. I’d argue that we’re on the cutting edge.</p><p>In particular, my preferences are to do all of my banking online or through mobile apps. I have a low threshold for mediocrity in this functionality and if a bank can’t get it right then I lose trust in their competence with not just technology but my money as well.</p><p>I see the future of banking being mostly online with much less reliance on physical locations. Due to my viewpoint, I’d lead a bank with a strategy of buying or building the best technology and taking money from physical locations to do that.</p><p>But you might not do the same. My strategy depends on my worldview and the future I see through my biases. I could be wrong about any or all of my assumptions. Should I hedge my bets by only moving halfway towards my new strategy and staying halfway in the old one?</p><p>I don’t think so. I think you should move forward with the strategy you see but keep your eyes open to signs that you might be on the wrong path. Find ways to test your assumptions along the way, but go forward with all your effort behind it.</p><p>While thinking through this exercise I’ve realized that we haven’t done any of this for our company. We thought we saw a need and are doing what we can to meet that need without any real plan. Maybe strategy comes later.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/01-21-delivering-bad-news", "title": "Delivering Bad News", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/01-21-delivering-bad-news", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I am awful at giving people bad news.

As I said yesterday, your results may vary and you need to find what works for you. So Seth made sure he was comfortable in that area so he could push himself out of comfort elsewhere.</p><p>Which brings up an important point. Comfort isn’t Kryptonite that your nemesis uses on you.

And really what I’m writing about isn’t a very interesting subject, but please give me a couple of minutes to tell you about something.</p><p>That something is software. Software made by small groups of people or maybe even just one person. Us in the industry call it “indie” software.</p><p>Indie software is made by a human being just like you (although that human probably has worse posture from sitting at a computer all day) and not a faceless corporation. That human being deeply cares about what she creates. I know that because if she didn’t then she wouldn’t be able to make a living off of it. Or perhaps she doesn’t make a living off of it but instead spends her free time bringing something new into the world. That’s even better in my eyes.</p><p>Just like a small business on Main Street, indie software creators really want to make you happy. They value your feedback and will do what they can to either fix your problem or add a feature. Obviously they can’t build every feature, but they’ll care enough to take the time to talk to you about it.</p><p>There isn’t always an indie software solution to your problem — some problems are too big for one person or a small team. But I’d like to ask you to do one small thing going forward:</p><p>Pay attention to who created your software. Was it Adobe Systems, a multinational corporation with over 11,000 employees who makes Photoshop? Or Flying Meat, a two person company who makes similar software called Acorn?</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/01-24-how-many-chances", "title": "How Many Chances", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/01-24-how-many-chances", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>A stranger walks up to you at a coffee bar, tries to sell you on something, and then lies or provides misleading information. How many chances do you give her? Will you listen to her a second or third time? Most likely not. You subconsciously set her reputation as low and won’t give her another chance. She’s coming into your brand new relationship with her hand out asking for something. And she’s building that relationship on an unstable foundation with no trust. You’ve got to be a kind hearted and patient person to give her another chance.</p><p>Let’s think through the same scenario, without the lies or misleading information. A person comes up to you at a coffee shop and tries to sell you on something. If you are honest with yourself, do you even listen to what she has to say? Or do you wait until she’s finished and politely decline? How many chances will you give that person? I doubt it would be many, if any, more than the first person.</p><p>If you have a perfect sales pitch with a 100% success rate then either of these strategies will work. But you don’t. You need more than one chance. You need to build a real relationship with the person you are selling to — going in with no intention of a sale and only an intention of forming a relationship. That takes time. And speaking of time, taking that person’s time is still asking without giving.</p><p>How many chances will you give a friend you’ve known for years?

So beware that.</p><p>I’ve had stomach issues for a long time — so long that I can’t remember not having them. My issues were diarrhea shortly following each meal and some nights I would spend hours on the toilet. During my year in Iraq, my two biggest worries were getting hit by a mortar while sitting in the port-o-potty and shitting my pants while outside the base. Excursions outside the base were troubling because they got me out of my routine.</p><p>Routine is critical with a gastronomical issue. That makes traveling and adventure not so fun. Life becomes an obstacle course and you become an expert at logistics, always thinking about what restrooms are available. Public restrooms transform from disgusting places you don’t ever want to use into places of salvation.</p><p>It is hard to explain the mental state that accompanies this condition. It’s a combination of fear, a sense of brokenness and that your body is letting you down. And it’s a secret you can’t share with the world because it’s so embarrassing, especially when you have no idea why it happens. It hurts your most important relationships — my significant others have thought that I spent hours in the bathroom to escape them.</p><p>Eventually, it just becomes a sad fact of life.</p><p>I tried what I could think of to solve the problem, approaching it like a science experiment, rationally. I removed dairy from my diet, no change. Removed onions, nothing. Avoided spicy foods, nope. Went to doctors that had me shit in a cup for close examination. Ugh, that’s gotta be a tough job for them. Still no answers.</p><p>My science experiment had a fundamental problem — the human body is a very complex machine and I could never control all the variables. Maybe stress is a factor, things seemed to get worse when I was stressed out, like being in a combat zone or in the tail end of a failing marriage. But that wasn’t a direct correlation either, I still got sick when I felt stress free.</p><p>So yeah, complex machine. The complexity of this machine coupled with my general ignorance of anything more than basic anatomy and physiology meant that I wasn’t going to be able to rationally deduce a solution.</p><p>Many times I gave up. Figured it was just how I was plumbed, overly sensitive and fundamentally broken.</p><p>About two years ago I removed wheat flour from my diet, just to try it. That is a tough thing to do here in North Texas, and it made me feel somewhat un-American. But the results were undeniable. I cannot describe what a joy it is to have a solid bowel movement (and how difficult it is to refrain from sharing the good news with those close to me to avoid grossing them out). After the initial positive results I gave up pretty much anything with wheat in it, the hardest of which was beer. In addition to feeling un-American I felt un-manly, but damn it’s worth it. I experienced an amazing side effect that I never would have expected — years of constant head congestion just went away. Studies show links between food and outdoor allergies, so I assume that was the mechanism.</p><p>Fortunately, around the same time that I went gluten free it became a diet trend and it is getting easier and easier to avoid it. Still, eating food cooked by anyone else is risky, and life is riddled with land mines like broccoli cheese soup, soy sauce and barbecue sauces. I usually avoid all sauces because they are just too dangerous.</p><p>Hope I didn’t gross you out too much. And I <em>really</em> hope that someone else going through what I went through reads this and I can help save some suffering.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/01-25-pack-mentality", "title": "Pack Mentality", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/01-25-pack-mentality", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Through coincidence I’ve been watching two different things that show the way that animals behave in a pack. The first, Cesar Millan’s <a href='https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesar_Millan%27s_Leader_of_the_Pack' title='Leader of the Pack'>Leader of the Pack</a> is about rehabilitating dogs and features Cesar’s pack as a large part of that rehabilitation. The second, <a href='https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bully_(2011_film)' title='Bully'>Bully</a> is a movie about the bullying problem in American public schools and features packs of adolescents tormenting individuals.</p><p>Each shows a different kind of pack, I’d describe the pack of dogs as highly functional and the pack of kids as highly dysfunctional. But are they the same thing?</p><p>At one point, Cesar introduces a dog to the pack that the entire pack shuns. The other dogs simply ignore her. Cesar attributes this behavior to the pack not liking that dog’s energy.</p><p>Is that the same thing that happens in bullying? Does the pack of kids not like that individual’s energy at some subconscious level? Is the bullying meant to bring that individual into line with the pack?</p><p>I don’t think so, but really I don’t know.</p><p>I was bullied growing up so I feel attached to this question. I still feel like an outsider to most groups despite being open-minded about many things. Am I too weak, strong, or different? Or have I always put myself in this role of outsider without realizing it?</p><p>A <a href='http://overca.st/BYAbXedFg' title='podcast I’ve listened to recently'>podcast I’ve listened to recently</a> brought up something I think is related to this discussion. The guest on the podcast, Jonathan Haidt, was talking about how political debates in American politics are not about trying to convince the other person, or people belonging to the other party, but rather to reinforce the bonds with people within your own party. They are a way of showing how good of a member of the pack that you are.</p><p>And maybe that’s what this pack behavior in kids is all about — maybe it is just the way that bullies get other bullies to like them more. Obviously if this is true it does not make the behavior any more justified, but knowing why someone behaves a way is powerful on its own.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/01-25-the-time-it-takes-to-make-a-change", "title": "The Time It Takes To Make A Change", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/01-25-the-time-it-takes-to-make-a-change", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Yesterday I was listening to the most recent <a href='http://www.asymcar.com/?p=524' title='Asymcar podcast'>Asymcar podcast</a> and one of the primary topics of discussion was about the market penetration of electric vehicles in the year 2040. OPEC made a claim that by 2040 only 6% of the world’s vehicles would be electric and the podcast’s host, Horace Dediu had crunched the numbers to see if that was a realistic number.

When I got there I walked into a room with 3 white men and was able to be comfortable. I don’t know these men very well right now and I’m sure if I get the opportunity to know them better than I’ll learn how good of people they are. But from the start I’m at an advantage by being a white man. I don’t feel like I’m doing a great job of talking through my privilege right now but I can certainly sense it.</p><p>When in doubt about a topic I choose silence. I haven’t known how to handle the way I feel about the injustices in this world. I definitely don’t want to glom onto a hashtag or event and claim it as my own when it isn’t.

As highly social creatures, we readily pick up on thoughts and habits in our environment that we may not notice in our daily lives.

I do the same with people that seem to constantly complain on Twitter, “high drama” friends that always need attention, and reality TV.</p><p>Instead, I read and listen to <a href='http://sethgodin.typepad.com' title='Seth Godin'>Seth Godin</a>, <a href='http://www.merlinmann.com' title='Merlin Mann'>Merlin Mann</a> (although he can be complain-y at times at which point I have to take some time away), <a href='http://joelonsoftware.com' title='Joel Spolsky'>Joel Spolsky</a>, <a href='http://www.stevenpressfield.com' title='Steven Pressfield'>Steven Pressfield</a>, <a href='http://danbenjamin.com' title='Dan Benjamin'>Dan Benjamin</a>, <a href='http://shawnblanc.net' title='Shawn Blanc'>Shawn Blanc</a>, and <a href='http://www.asymco.com' title='Horace Dediu'>Horace Dediu</a>.

That prompted me to think about that ability to “walk in someone else’s shoes” and after that reflection I think it is one of my biggest strengths. I believe it helps me be more reasonable about decisions, see more options in any given situation, communicate better with all kinds of people, and build things that appeal to more people that just ones like me.</p><p>That leads me to two questions.</p><p>First, how do I convince others that seeing things from someone else’s point of view is a good thing, a sign of a strength and not of weakness. That seeing something from a different perspective and changing your mind is not a bad thing. I don’t know an answer to this other than “lead by example.”</p><p>Second, how does a person cultivate the ability to see these different perspectives? I think the best way is providing a variety of life experiences in vastly different situations. I’ve lived the life of a poor person, a rich person, an athlete, a nerd, a criminal, a good citizen, a soldier, and a pacifist. Putting yourself in foreign situations is a good thing even if it feels uncomfortable. But even if you can’t put yourself in all those different situations right now you can still notice how other people live.

At the same time I like working on projects rather than little individual items like returning emails or fixing bugs. I like creating something from nothing and introducing it to the world. That feels like magic to me.</p><p>When our business is building software from nothing for clients we have to have a handful of projects all going at once so we have make enough money to survive. That reality is stressing me out a bit because I want it all done right now. I want to finish things and instead I’m making a little bit of progress across a number of different tasks but some days it feels like I’m barely moving or even moving backwards. I just want to cross it of the list and forget about it!</p><p>So I need to find a way to make this situation work for me. I think it is ok to feel uncomfortable and overwhelmed at times, which I do right now. I think that’s healthy, even.

I started this migration last weekend and got my tail whooped — everything took longer than I expected and I ran out of weekend before I overcame all the problems that popped up.</p><p>Last night I approached the problem with a fresh mind and a new plan of attack I’d come up with over the week. But while the plan of attack got me started, I don’t owe the successful server migration to it. I owe it to realizing I was approaching the problem wrong.</p><p>Any reasonably complex system starts to feel like magic. An operating system, like Windows Server, is a very complex system. All that complexity hides causes and effects from you because there is no way to see exactly what is going on everywhere in the system. I’d gotten lost in this complexity and forgotten the power of causality. After struggling with the problem all last weekend I’d gotten lost in the complexity. I wrote off the migration failure as a sort of magic, thinking and saying “if it failed the first time it will probably fail again.” I’d lost my power over the situation because I didn’t think I could change it.</p><p>Last night I ran into problems again, some the same as last time and a couple new ones too. But this week things changed when somewhere along the way a new idea clicked. I thought “I need to figure out what is going wrong so I can fix it.” Sounds simple, I know, but it had escaped me.</p><p>First step, figure out what is going wrong. The system is too complex to see all the moving pieces at once, but I can look at individual parts. What tools do I need to do that? What information do those tools give me? How can I use that information to solve the problem? Repeat those three questions until you solve all the problems, with a little bit of thought about whether one problem could be causing another and whether you need to stay focused, or bounce between the different problems, or broadly attack all of them.

This monster shows up when you want an application to work for everyone, like when you want an app that works for both Android phones and iPhones. But despite that example, this monster wasn’t brought to life by the smartphone. Before smartphones, Cross Platform Development could mean Mac and Windows, Windows and Linux, or any such combination. This problem has been around for at least 30 years and software developers have been looking for solutions for nearly as long.</p><p>I’m firmly in the “anti-Silver Bullet” camp — I believe that software development is a complex task that cannot be simplified without losing something. By losing something, I mean that to simplify software development you have to compromise somewhere else, in performance, customization, control, or design. I don’t like compromise. I also believe that humans are much more flexible than computers and they should be the part of the system that bends to make things work rather than expecting the machine to do it.</p><p>I’ll talk through the benefits of the Cross Platform Development Silver Bullet because, despite my bias, I do see definite benefits.</p><p>The biggest benefit of the Cross Platform Development Silver Bullet is that you have a single code base rather than having a separate one for every platform. This is good because it takes time and money to write code, fix bugs, and test applications. Those costs are greatly reduced with a single code base and not just during initial creation of the application but for the years of maintenance that follow. This seems like a simple concept but it is a huge deal.</p><p>Another benefit is developers don’t need to learn as many languages. A single code base will probably be written in a single language and you might also need to speak the databases’ language (although the hip thing these days is to have the database speak the same language as the code base.) a single language means it is easier to find software developers that speak that language. If you want to write native (the opposite of Cross Platform) apps for every platform right now, you’d need to speak somewhere between 3 and 5 languages minimum.</p><p>In most evaluations this would be the point where I’d share the downsides of the Cross Platform Development Silver Bullet. But it has no downsides. The problem is that it doesn’t exist. In specific, it doesn’t exist for what I need software to do. I do think there are situations where a Cross Platform Development Silver Bullet could work — situations where the compromises are OK.  Let me tell you why it won’t work for me.</p><p>First, it is too risky. These Silver Bullets are code bases themselves, software written by teams employed by large technology companies. These companies can afford to have very smart people working on open source projects because it makes sense for them at the time. But what if that changes? What if the company changes its priorities or goes out of business? The code you’ve written will become useless, not immediately but over a relatively short time of months or years. You’ll have to rebuild everything. You may be thinking “it is open source, someone else will pick it up!” Which may be true, but will they be as devoted to the project as the original team? Will they be as smart as that team? What are their incentives? Again, too risky.</p><p>Second, and this ties in with the first reason, you will only be able to use the tools that the developers of the Silver Bullet give to you. If a shiny new feature comes out and those developers decide not to implement it, or worse, give you just a little control over it but not full control, then you can’t use it the way you’d like to. You may be thinking “well that’s no different than if Apple hasn’t provided the feature” but you’re wrong. It is different because other apps can use the feature and users of your app will see that. If others can do it and you can’t then you’re at a disadvantage.</p><p>Third, you will always be a little bit behind the features that native developers will get. The Silver Bullet works because people write code to make it work on multiple platforms. If a new feature comes out you have to wait for those people to write the code to enable it. And what if one platform has a feature that another doesn’t? How does that work? I don’t know, but the Silver Bullet can only solve that in two ways, either making you write that code yourself or not including that feature on either platform (I suppose there is a third way which involves adding a note in bold to the documentation letting you know that it only works on one platform, but that’s not a great option.) Again, you’ll always be behind.</p><p>Fourth, your application won’t feel right. This is the mushiest point I’ll make, but we are a mushy species. Each platform has its own design style which is one of the ways that they differentiate themselves. Each platform is motivated and incentivized to keep their style unique. That design style goes further than the way things look, it is the way they function too. The way things look is easier for these Silver Bullets to get right. But the easiest way to make the functionality right across platforms is by limiting options. This means you can’t differentiate your app as much as you might like. It also means that all apps built with the Silver Bullet start looking the same.</p><p>Do I believe that every app should be native? No. I believe you need to use a different tool for different situations after weighing the benefits and drawbacks. I don’t believe there is a one size fits all solution.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/02-01-building-confidence", "title": "Building Confidence", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/02-01-building-confidence", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Confidence doesn’t come naturally to me. When I was young I was shy and timid and nothing changed much as I grew up. I was different enough from the other kids in elementary school that I got made fun of and bullied. My lack of confidence probably reached a peak my junior year of high school when I didn’t say more than a few sentences to my peers the entire year.</p><p>Today I’m very confident. I strongly believe I can do anything I put my mind to doing. I believe I owe my confidence to taking on challenges that tested my faith in myself and overcoming them. What do I mean by “challenges that tested my faith in myself?” I’ll explain.</p><p>Despite my confidence today I still doubt myself. When I hit trouble on a project a voice in the back of my head starts calling me names. Stupid, incompetent, a fraud, in way over my head. That’s my fear talking and it is a great sign that I’m challenging myself the right amount.</p><p>That fear can be enough to break your will and make you stop and declare failure. But if you push through it to the end and declare victory then you’ll build your confidence. After a few experiences like that you’ll be unstoppable.</p><p>My key takeaway about building confidence is that it comes from putting yourself in situations where failure is possible. You can’t fool your fear with simple tasks that you can easily overcome. You have to forge your confidence in the fire of challenges that test your faith in yourself.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/02-01-sweeping-up-after-yourself", "title": "Sweeping Up After Yourself", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/02-01-sweeping-up-after-yourself", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>We recently had a glass company come to our house to repair a broken window.

The systems we had in place for communication (email) and project management (email and Excel) failed quickly in the new environment. I’m a systems and infrastructure kind of guy so I took the lead on figuring out what we needed and the best solutions for it.</p><p>In no particular order, here are the conclusions I came to along with some notes on different options for each.</p><h2 id='Issue-Tracker'>Issue Tracker</h2><p>To save money we went with <a href='http://www.mantisbt.org' title='Mantis'>Mantis</a>, a free and open source issue tracking web application written in PHP. I did some tweaking to the CSS so it wasn’t absolutely awful to look at and we came up with a pretty good workflow involving projects and versions. If I didn’t want to pay for a system then I’d definitely use Mantis again.</p><p>Fortunately for very small teams, Fog Creek Software offers <a href='http://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/' title='FogBugz'>FogBugz</a> for free to teams of two people. FogBugz is great and I highly recommend it.</p><h2 id='Source-Control'>Source Control</h2><p>Being a .NET shop we debated between Team Foundation Server and Git for our source control system. I had never used either in a team environment but based upon my research I really liked the workflows available in Git that couldn’t be done with Team Foundation. We first tried hosting the Git repositories on our own server but maintaining that took too much of my time and performance was awful. After fighting with it for a few months we started paying for GitHub.</p><p>GitHub is probably the best option for a small technology company with more than two people. If you only have two people, FogBugz has source control built-in through Kiln.</p><h2 id='Chat'>Chat</h2><p>I want to keep as much as possible out of the email inbox. Email inboxes easily get overwhelming and are too private — I embrace transparency and want everyone to know what is going on and group chat is a great way to do that.</p><p>I highly recommend <a href='http://slack.com' title='Slack'>Slack</a> and nothing else. As a bonus, Slack is very well designed and performs flawlessly in my experience. Using it will give your team something to aim for.</p><h2 id='Email'>Email</h2><p>Since we had a large corporate client and needed Microsoft Office we went with Office 365. I was pleased with the service and the software. The only small complaint I have is that the administration screens are a bit wonky. I’ve also heard good things about FastMail if you only need email.</p><p>Anything Google related is not on my approved list because I don’t like their business model, although their applications are quite popular.</p><h2 id='Wiki'>Wiki</h2><p>Some may debate me on the necessity of a wiki, but I couldn’t go without one. This is the place you store everything that you will or may need to look back up again one day. I love them for documentation and training. We went with <a href='https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki' title='DokuWiki'>DokuWiki</a> because it was free, open source, and had a single sign-on plugin for Mantis.</p><p>Fortunately for teams of two, FogBugz has a wiki built in for free.</p><h2 id='Web-Server'>Web Server</h2><p>A place to host your website and any applications you build for yourself. I get all my servers from <a href='https://www.ch3data.com' title='CH3 Data'>CH3 Data</a> in Austin, Texas because they care about reducing their power consumption which is good for the environment.</p><p>We got a Windows server because we did .NET development.

How the hell do I get back to the main screen?</p><p>Turns out, Paper’s pinching method to return to the main screen is very intuitive and once I took a few minutes to calm down, I figured it out. But why am I so afraid? Because I’ve been using apps that aren’t intuitive at all, and that has made me cautious. Double tapping in NetBot to see a conversation, or swiping to the right in the new Twitteriffic? It’s just weird. And the problem is that you don’t know what else might happen if you make a gesture.</p><p>So since I’m whining, I’ll provide a solution. If you say that gestures are similar to keyboard shortcuts because they are for power users, then you’re lying. Wait, I mean then we need to have similar gestures across apps for gestures to be usable for any group other than nerds. Why is command c so useful? It is the same across the system. We have one gesture that already fits this requirement - pull to refresh. Natural and systemwide. Easily discoverable. And seriously, if you are using the argument that gestures are like keyboard shortcuts, then you are deluding yourself and not making hard choices about what features need to stay and go.

I start with the most simple situation possible by hard coding known good values. For example, if I’m logging a user into a system I won’t build the part to get the username and password from the user at the start. I’ll code a username and password that I know will work directly into the application.

Most of the time she is smiling, singing, playing her piano, or doing a combination of those. She’s been remarkably resilient, further proving to me that life is amazing and will find a way.</p><p>Happy Birthday Emma. You make this world a much better place.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/02-07-in-defense-of-shorter-lifespans", "title": "In Defense of Shorter Lifespans", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/02-07-in-defense-of-shorter-lifespans", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>We are a low bandwidth species and the older we get the more slowly we learn. By low bandwidth I mean that our consciousness is not able to handle very much information — therefore we cannot learn quickly because we just can’t handle anything but the very slowest trickle of teaching.</p><p>This only gets worse as we get older. We move less and do the same things repeatedly. Our bodies atrophy and our minds grow bored without the novelty of change. We accumulate stuff and grow attached to it and fight anything that might take it away — further cementing our fixed patterns of living because any change could make the whole thing fall apart.</p><p>These fixed patterns get reinforced throughout society.

The youth that grow up with a smartphone in their hands are starting far ahead of where we did. Today’s technology will be second nature to them, just as yesterday’s technology was second nature to us. This allows their mind to work in ways that ours don’t naturally and probably can’t.</p><p>If we continue lengthening our lives in an endless quest to live forever we do so while crippling the future of our race. There will be no room for youth. Our minds will calcify and we will fight for our own individual agendas rather than for our race. Our forward progress will stop, then regress, and send us to a dark age.</p><p>I have no desire to live forever.

This interest started when a tree fell in my backyard and I had to get rid of it. I found out it was a hackberry. Hackberry trees are very common in this part of Texas and are generally referred to as “trash trees.” They are the tree version of weeds. From what I can tell they are highly susceptible to mistletoe and falling over.</p><p>Hackberries were my gateway tree. I knew what 10 of the trees in my yard were, but what were the rest? The same person who told me what a hackberry is also told me a few of the trees are elms and one was a pecan. Just today I was working in the yard and noticed another was a pecan. I can’t help but look at a new tree and wonder what kind it is.</p><p>A few weeks ago I grew curious about the tree that is growing in the middle of our porch. It is a pretty evergreen that has small cherries. I looked it up online and figured out it is a Carolina cherry laurel. Cool thing about the cherry laurel — its leaves and bark have a chemical that turns into hydrogen cyanide — a deadly poison — when damaged. Crushed leaves have the sweet smell of maraschino cherries.</p><p>It is amazing to me how dramatically learning can change my perspective. Trees have been a good way for me to notice and visualize that.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/02-10-constant-motion-or-constant-forward-movement", "title": "Constant Motion or Constant Forward Movement", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/02-10-constant-motion-or-constant-forward-movement", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I can put all my energy into something and still get nowhere with it.

The length of the talk doesn’t correspond perfectly to the length of my drive. And mobile Safari has a way of reloading tabs due to memory demands, which means that I would regularly lose my place in the middle of listening to a talk.</p><p>So I started making an app to solve those problems. This past December Mission Dharma gave me permission to put it on the iOS App Store.</p><p>You can <a href='http://iTunes.apple.com/us/app/dharma-talks/id807331897?mt=8' title='find it here'>find it here</a>, for free.

Whether we are sitting at desk jobs, in the car or public transit on the way to work, or on our couch at night, we aren’t moving.</p><p>Our bodies need to move to function correctly — movement is inherent to their design. When we don’t move enough our bodily systems stop working properly. Our lymphatic system, which is responsible for carrying waste from tissues all over the body, stops moving and starts pooling up. Rather than being carrying away and out of the body our tissues sit right next to these toxins which is a bad thing.</p><p>Many will say that hope is lost. That once you’ve stopped moving and your body has become unhealthy that it is irreparably damaged. I don’t buy that. Our bodies are amazingly well equipped at healing themselves, we just have to set them up for success. Start moving more today, and move deliberately. When you move think about how your blood vessels and lymphatic system will be stimulated by your movement. Find something that moves your entire body and gets your blood pumping. Take your time, build yourself up slowly over time, and don’t over do it. Be consistent over a long time. That’s the secret to success and good health.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/02-13-teaching-myself", "title": "Teaching Myself", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/02-13-teaching-myself", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>In most ways, learning things on my own is a great thing. I avoid the pitfalls of folklore and superstition that teachers come up with when understanding events but having imperfect information, and we always have imperfect information. Making my own fresh mistakes instead of listening to others’ old mistakes can lead me to solutions that others might never try. Reinventing wheels means that I can form a better understanding of why the wheel was made the way it was. Teaching myself means that I don’t have to change my mental models to match those of the teacher.</p><p>Mental models are how we simplify our world so that it makes sense to us. My mental model for learning new things is the type of video game where the map lights up as you explore it — like what happens in map strategy games like StarCraft.</p><p>At the beginning of the game the entire map is black other than the small circle that you know which is lit up. Then as you explore the map you find out more about the terrain and where the dangers are. I find that thinking about learning in this way makes it a little less intimidating to me. It isn’t that I’m not getting it, it’s that I haven’t been able to figure out a way to get to that part of the map. Takes the ego out of it, the part of you that gets angry and frustrated because you feel stupid.</p><p>This video game mental model doesn’t hold up for one of the most important parts of teaching yourself — ensuring that you draw the right conclusions from what you experience. In the video game you explore and what you understand is what you see in front of you. There are no further conclusions to be drawn. In other words, you know what is there because you see it.</p><p>When teaching yourself what you understand is based upon the reasoning you use to interpret your experiences. The map is only as good as the conclusions that you draw about it. For example, if you are learning to program and make a wrong assumption about the way something works then you will not have seen the real map. You have to be wary of both what you think you experience and your reasoning. We aren’t particularly good at getting either right.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/02-14-finding-new-and-conflicting-ideas", "title": "Finding New And Conflicting Ideas", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/02-14-finding-new-and-conflicting-ideas", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>It is easy to get caught up in the everyday life you live with the job, group of friends, and family you’ve always had.

And sometimes that is OK — I don’t always need data to support my opinions. I will never find data to support why I think vanilla is better than chocolate.</p><p>The supporting data is what changes an opinion into a theory or a complaint into a criticism. It forces you to prove your beliefs to yourself because you have to collect and validate the data. It doesn’t allow you to hide behind lazy statements like “ask any professional violinist and you’ll know what I mean.” It also spurs conversation because it gives your audience specific points to discuss.</p><p>When I make a statement and don’t provide my supporting data it is usually due to one or more of three reasons: I’m being lazy, I’m asserting an opinion on something about which I have no data, or I’m assuming a tacit level of knowledge in my readers. I think reasons two and three are OK. As I’ve written about before I believe it is valuable to share my opinions even if they are not fully formed. Sometimes I’ll just have to say “this is how I feel about it but I’m not exactly sure why.” And we all have to assume a certain level of tacit knowledge, although I think I’ll constantly be working on the right balance.</p><p>But laziness isn’t a good excuse. Trying to prove a point with hand-wavy “facts” is worse than stating an opinion because it is trying to trick your audience and probably trying to trick yourself.

The video contains tons of great information and the tools that Google provides for free look fantastic.</p><p>One of the coolest tools, and one that I didn’t know about before this video, was a tool that allows Webmasters to do A/B testing of their sites. If you aren’t familiar with A/B testing, the general concept is that each visitor will be shown a different version of your site, an A version and a B version, randomly but in equal proportions over the same period of time. So for example, over the next week half the visitors to my site will see a version A with a big green button for proceeding to the next step and the other half will see a big orange version for proceeding to the next step. The point of the tool is to see whether A or B is the better design based upon what percentage of users get to the next step for each.</p><p>The Google presenter describing this tool talked about how difficult it is to know whether a design is truly good just by looking at it. He recommends that this version of “design by data” is the optimal way to create any site.</p><p>I want very badly to disagree with this. I have a gut feeling that it is wrong but it is very difficult to argue against the data-centered reasoning from Google.</p><p>My gut says that designers will use this data as a crutch — as a way to defend lazy design that looks exactly like the design they’ve put out previously. “No, we can’t do it that way, remember we tested it.”</p><p>I think another step in the testing process needs to be added — figuring out why it works. Why does design A work better than design B? If you can’t find out why then you can’t add anything to your stockpile of design wisdom. Once you can find out why then you can iterate off of that reason to find an entirely new set of designs. You can use that data point to spark creativity rather than inadvertently stifling it.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/02-16-pushing-too-hard", "title": "Pushing Too Hard", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/02-16-pushing-too-hard", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I can tell I’ve been pushing too hard lately.

She does an excellent job of describing how that role demeans women, robs them of any personality, and rather than making the hero’s cause noble the role makes women the ball in a game between two men.</p><p>This new-to-me perspective is fascinating. I’m hoping it will be one of those things where when I see it once I can’t help but see it everywhere. While watching the videos I kept thinking about how our society reinforces this idea of men saving the damsel in distress. This is what all the classic fairy tales that I can remember revolve around. This is the model for young boys’ behavior — this is what is respected and expected by society.</p><p>But I can’t argue with Anita’s logic. The damsel in distress is the ball. Or maybe she is the trophy that you hold up high and put on a shelf collecting dust at home. Either way, the game is not about the woman.

The ideas seem so foreign. For example, for much of my life I thought I could find the “higher truths” of life in music. I doubt I’m alone in this. I don’t know if it was because the music was popular that made me believe that the lyrics held so much meaning. Maybe it was the melancholy music that gave them a certain kind of gravity that I equated with meaning. Either way, I know I was searching for something and that search led to song lyrics.</p><p>I was reminded of this tonight by a Jack Johnson song. Don’t remember the name of it, but it is the one that goes “I used to think that maybe, pretty much means no” or something to that effect. Don’t know why it triggered this memory — he wasn’t the only one that held this power over my younger mind — The Counting Crows, Live, Nada Surf, Ben Folds Five, and Third Eye Blind are several more I remember.</p><p>It is obvious now that none of them knew anything more than I know now. Each was trying to find her own way just like we all are.</p><p>I think this idea is one of the ones that shapes who I am the most right now. The idea that few universal truths exist. Everything else is true for me or for you and sometimes for the two of us, but not universally so. We are all trying to find our own truths.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/02-18-the-encryption-debate-and-seeing-the-other-side", "title": "The Encryption Debate And Seeing The Other Side", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/02-18-the-encryption-debate-and-seeing-the-other-side", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I believe that back doors in any security system are bad.

Another team built it sometime in the past, using HTML and PHP. My first task was figuring out why the form wasn’t working intermittently and then to fix it. Intermittent issues are frustrating by themselves but get even more so when you have no idea which parts of what are doing what actions and have to dig through the code to figure it out. Every implementation of sending email is fundamentally the same, but that still leaves a huge opportunity for different implementation choices.</p><p>This incident made me realize a part of my preference for building websites that feels contrary to my usual philosophy. Usually I want to control everything and that control generally means building components myself and keeping them on my own server. But I don’t want to build form submission components. I don’t want to run PHP or any other language on my server if I can help it. I don’t want to slow down my site with any of that complexity, and I don’t want to have to worry about the additional attack vectors that enabling a server side language or database create.</p><p>I just want a widget, that I can fully customize, that handles form submission for me.

Pushing an obstacle out of the way because you don’t have the time, skills, or tools to do something more intelligently. But you will get worn out and brute force is not sustainable. For anything more than short term efforts it makes sense to grab a tool or learn the skills to do something smarter.</p><p>There is a balance and no right answer. If you fancy yourself an intelligent person then you probably don’t use brute force enough. If you think that using tools is for people who lack strength then you probably use brute force too much.</p><p>Find a good balance by weighing the situation at hand. If you need something working in the very near future then brute force is probably the way to go. That’s also true if you will only be doing this thing once. I’ll share an example.</p><p>I’ve been working on building an Android app and I have a short timeline to build it. I don’t understand how the Android UI layout system works so I’m just trying different combinations until I find one that works. It feels uncomfortable because I feel like I don’t know what I’m doing but it moves me forward and gets me where I want to be, which is having a fully functional and well designed app in a short timeline.</p><p>I also know that this won’t be my only Android app. So my next step is to learn the tools and the fundamentals of Android UI design so that I don’t have to brute force it in the future. I just don’t have time to learn it all before this project’s deadline.</p><p>As with all things there is no absolute right answer. Each situation needs to be weighed separately for the right way to approach it. Don’t get stuck in either system.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/02-20-excitement,-excitement,-fear-and-responsibility", "title": "Excitement, Excitement, Fear And Responsibility", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/02-20-excitement,-excitement,-fear-and-responsibility", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Closing the sale, making the plans, then realizing “oh shit I have to follow through on this.” I find that the first two are so much fun.

I was too busy learning how to build anything to worry about building something quick. I also came into programming with the thought that computers are fast enough to fly through any code I send at them. That’s true for simple applications. But I’ve been fortune to have multiple opportunities to learn good lessons about performance. My projects got bigger and more complicated and the servers I was given to work with were 10-15 years old and they were slow and memory constrained</p><p>I’m glad I was given that situation and glad that I’ve grown. Now I see speed as a must-have feature in any application I create. Because of that I prefer tools that help me build performant applications. I shy away from frameworks and generic solutions because they add more overhead than I’d like. They have to solve more problems than I have and solving those problems slows things down. So I’ll build a static website instead of using a CMS if I can solve every problem I’m trying to solve while doing it. For this same reason I prefer to build native applications instead of using frameworks that might be easier for me but could be slower.</p><p>Speed matters — probably more than you think.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/02-22-bullying-is-never-ok", "title": "Bullying Is Never OK", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/02-22-bullying-is-never-ok", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>In my experience, one of the worst things about being bullied is my internal voice saying “you’re over-reacting, it is no big deal, she isn’t being that mean.” That internal voice is wrong.

But really, a project is a lot like a living thing and sometimes we just need to take it where it needs us to go.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/02-24-technology-for-the-real-world", "title": "Technology For The Real World", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/02-24-technology-for-the-real-world", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>As a technology enthusiast it is fun to get caught up in the cutting edge technology and latest gadgets.

I highly recommend reading the book.</p><p>He has a section in the book where he talks about setting standards for his team of product managers. <a href='http://web.stanford.edu/class/e140/e140a/handouts/ProductMgmt.txt' title='Here'>Here</a> is his original document. Below is my adaptation based upon the standards I would have in place for any software developer working for me. Note, the last two are taken directly from Ben’s list.</p><p>A good software developer assumes that the Client is an expert in their field, and that she is a very intelligent person. A bad software developer assumes that the Client does not know what she is talking about because she doesn’t understand technology.</p><p>A good software developer makes expert suggestions about technology and design options. A bad software developer tells the Client she is wrong.</p><p>A good software developer communicates clearly in a way that is native to the listener. For example, if she is talking with someone on the East Coast, she will go out of her way to provide times for the Eastern time zone. A bad software developer communicates using technical terms and jargon and expects the Client to make the effort to understand her.</p><p>A good software developer creates software that is simple and powerful for the Client to use, despite the complexities in initial development and maintenance that that may entail. The software she creates will be used many times per day, and only created and maintained a handful of times. A bad software developer creates software that is easy for her to create.</p><p>A good software developer makes opinionated decisions based upon expertise, experience and knowledge of the business and client. A good software developer owns the “how” of creating great software. A bad software developer asks for a detailed specification for every decision and stops moving forward until she gets it.</p><p>A good software developer knows that sometimes you have to incur technical debt and you always have to pay it off. A bad software developer ignores technical debt, leading to shortcuts, fragile solutions and a future of putting out fires.</p><p>A good software developer asks questions. A bad software developer makes assumptions.</p><p>A good software developer builds the best possible solution for the Client. A bad software developer builds either the easiest possible solution for herself or the funnest possible solution to build.</p><p>A good software developer adopts new technology as it makes sense. A bad software developer either sticks with the same technology long after it is relevant or flits around between new technologies like a hummingbird.</p><p>Good software developers err on the side of clarity vs. explaining the obvious. Bad software developers never explain the obvious.</p><p>Good software developers define their job and their success. Bad software developers constantly want to be told what to do.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/02-28-davids-rules---barber-shops", "title": "David’s Rules - Barber Shops", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/02-28-davids-rules---barber-shops", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Another post in <a href='http://brunow.org/2015/01/31/davids-rules---apologies/' title='my series of David’s Rules'>my series of David’s Rules</a>:</p><p>Barber shops must have a barber’s pole and be closed on Sunday and Monday.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/02-28-intent", "title": "Intent", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/02-28-intent", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>How much does your intention driving something you do shape that thing?

I’m a little nervous about releasing this podcast to the world but I also know it can’t be perfect. This is the first one I’ve ever done, I will get better, and right now I’m only experimenting. I’m finding my voice and my subject matter.</p><p>This reminds me of something I used to do when I was in high school. I used to say and believe “if I only tried I’d get all A’s.” That was hiding. I was hiding from my potential and from the potential for failure. I wasn’t risking anything.</p><p>When starting something new I find it easy to let myself off the hook. But I struggle with deciding when it is hiding. When do I call myself out for not writing well enough to attract an audience? When do I face the fact that I’m not putting all of me into it — when I am subconsciously saying “if I only tried I’d have tons of people reading what I write.” Am I being true to myself or am I sheltering myself?</p><p>I don’t know how to answer these questions.

The only measure is through comparison which is a path to misery.</p><p>I’m going to keep going with what I’ve been doing — creating things that I think others will find valuable.

One of the biggest areas I need to improve is in scheduling my time and projects. I’ve felt this more than ever before in the last month as every project took longer than I estimated and spilled over into the time for the next project. Fortunately I can still deliver things on time by working more but that only works in the short term. Eventually I’ll run out of energy and burn out.</p><p>I have a new appreciation for why consulting companies emphasize limiting scope creep. Adding just one little feature can change the length of the entire project and then impact other projects. Despite my new appreciation I still believe that most limits on changes in scope mean that the final product isn’t as good as it could be. You still won’t hear me fight against implementing a good idea because it wasn’t in the original scope. The original scope didn’t know what we know now and each decision to add something must be weighed on its own.</p><p>I think the way we’ll approach the problem of overwork is by saying no to projects. The combination of wanting to help everyone and projects being hard to come by in our first year meant we’ve said yes to every project we’ve had an opportunity to do. Once we aren’t concerned with feeding ourselves we will feel more comfortable saying “sorry we’re too busy right this moment.”</p><p>I think that will be the biggest part of keeping ourselves at the right level or work. The other thing that got us in a situation of being overworked this month was projects that kept going for months while we waiting on others to do their things. Unfortunately multiple of those were ready for us at the same time which in my mind is something we can’t predict or control but just have to live with and fight through.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/03-04-doing-things-the-hard-way-vs-doing-things-the-right-way", "title": "Doing Things The Hard Way Vs Doing Things The Right Way", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/03-04-doing-things-the-hard-way-vs-doing-things-the-right-way", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’m a strong proponent of doing things the right way. I don’t take shortcuts and try to follow best practices. I do my best not to lie or even give the perception that I might be lying.</p><p>I think that’s all good — although I do struggle with some of it which is a topic for another time. I think doing things the right way has benefits that you can’t even imagine when you are doing it. Also, sometimes the hard way is the right way, but as I’ll describe later that isn’t always the case.</p><p>I don’t want to limit this solely to a technical topic, but I have a good example from software development. For over a decade, Apple’s main programming language, Objective-C, only had manual memory management. That means that developers had to do extra work to ensure that the memory was being used properly and that their application wasn’t taking up too much. Software for Windows was generally built using memory management that was handled by the system. It is called garbage collection, if you care to know. Software for Windows was easier to build because the developer didn’t have to think about something as archaic as memory — after all, memory was cheap so why waste time on that?</p><p>Of course, that thinking was back around 2005 or 2006 and desktop computers had plenty of memory. But in 2007, Apple introduced the iPhone which was severely constrained on memory — not much could fit into such a small device. And I believe that Apple doing things the right way — forcing their developers to manage their own memory — is one of the reasons that the iPhone was a success. Maybe the leadership at Apple knew how much the manual memory management would benefit them, but I doubt it. I think it was their commitment to doing things the right way that did it.</p><p>I have a different problem though, and I wonder if any of y’all share it. My problem is that I don’t want things to be too easy because then I don’t feel as talented. Sometimes, I will intentionally do things in a more difficult way for some reason. Maybe to prove to myself that I can? Maybe to rationalize to myself why my skill set is in high demand?</p><p>I’m not sure. And I don’t know that it is completely a bad thing, although I waste some time I could be making something. But I think it would be far worse if I got complacent and found the easiest possible way to do things.</p><p>So I’m going to try to call myself out on this in the future and own up to it. I’ll use best practices and what I believe is the right way to do things and adjust this foible of mine as I go.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/03-04-not-just-one-thing", "title": "Not Just One Thing", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/03-04-not-just-one-thing", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>It’s never just one thing.

From that I know a lot about the game, but while watching a game the other day I saw the game in a way I hadn’t seen it before. I saw a system in equilibrium.</p><p>Each offensive player was guarded closely by a defensive player. The offense for each team was unable to change the equilibrium. Each time they went down the court they would pass the ball around a few times and shoot a three pointer. Something obvious became clear — the only way for change to happen is for the system to become unbalanced. One way that happens in basketball is by a player making a move to the basket past his defender and causing another player’s defender to stop him. This unbalances the system, leaving a player open.</p><p>Writing it out it seems so obvious. But despite years of playing basketball I hadn’t put it together. I thought the purpose of each play was to try to score but now I don’t think so. I think the purpose is to cause an imbalance and the score is a nice benefit of that — an instant feedback system for good work.</p><p>This applies everywhere. The way to cause change is to throw a system out of whack. This idea really helps me visualize the impact we can make in the world. Being able to see it in my mind serves as a great source of motivation.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/03-06-handling-changing-business-needs-and-clients", "title": "Handling Changing Business Needs And Clients", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/03-06-handling-changing-business-needs-and-clients", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>We’ve gotten a few things wrong as we’ve gotten our business going.

She could have easily reached it and picked it back up but instead she leaned her body over the armrest and played with it while it was on the floor. She made things much harder on herself because she didn’t want to put the effort into slowing down for a moment, picking it up, and making the situation right.</p><p>Do you ever find this happening to you? I sure do. And sometimes I even know when I am in the middle of it but I rarely talk myself out of it. Rather than take a few possibly more difficult minutes to figure out how to set up the situation properly, I’ll bang my head against it over and over again until it relents.</p><p>Let’s take working on a car as an example. Something like removing the valve cover to fix its seal (don’t worry, no prior knowledge of automobile maintenance is necessary.) The process for removing the valve cover is to remove the bolts holding it down, remove the spark plug wires, and then pry up the cover from the head. The quick and seemingly easier way to do that is to follow my instructions just as I said. Within a few minutes your have the valve cover off and can replace the seal. But then you have to put the bolts back in and put the spark plug wires back in place. This is where the “beating your head against a problem” part comes in. You can eventually get the bolts back in the right places and get the wires in the right holes, but it may take you a while. Especially if something else goes wrong in the process and you get sidetracked onto another task. Maybe you crack the valve cover and have to order a new one which will take a week. It’s not likely that you’ll remember the layout of the bolts and wires.</p><p>So it’s much better to take your time. Slow down just a bit and take a picture of where everything goes at the beginning. Ignore that urge to dive right in just a bit. And when you take each of the bolts out, lay them somewhere in the same position as they were when they were in the valve cover. Then you’ll know where they came from and where they need to go. That’s especially important if any of them are different sizes. Just slowing down a little and exercising discipline can make the difference between a few minutes and a few days of work.</p><p>I don’t think that the stubbornness of beating your head against problems is all bad. Sometimes the exact thing you need is to keep slogging and all the setting up in the world will just slow you down. You can paralyze yourself by overthinking.</p><p>But much of the time slowing down and getting things in their proper places first is the better way to go.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/03-07-thinking-in-systems", "title": "Thinking In Systems", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/03-07-thinking-in-systems", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>The best way to build complicated things is to think of each part as a component in a system.

I’m not letting the popular media work me up in a frenzy over silly epidemics and I’m not paying attention to Kim Kardashian’s latest who knows what. I don’t let mass media influence me very much because I carefully curate my media consumption. Mostly this is a good thing. It allows me to focus on what matters to me and avoid much of the unnecessary negativity of the world.</p><p>But I also use it to escape the anger and sadness I feel when I know about situations that I don’t feel like I can change. Like Ferguson. Like the awful inequality that blacks face in our country. Like the biases our society has against women. Everything in this world that separates humans from the truth that we are all the same and we all bleed the same blood and love with the same hearts. All these issues tear open my heart and so I shut them out of my life.</p><p>But I don’t think that’s OK anymore. I don’t have solutions to any of it but that doesn’t mean I should shut it out. If I don’t let it hurt my heart then I’ll never stumble across that opportunity to do something when it arises. I won’t be open to any solutions that may come to mind to help me stop the pain.</p><p>So I’m taking some of my blinders off. I’ll still ignore most mass media, but I won’t ignore the plight of my fellow woman and man. I’ll soak it in deeply to my soul and use it to do what I can to help others.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/03-09-falling-off", "title": "Falling Off", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/03-09-falling-off", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Yesterday I didn’t write a blog post.

I’ve taken a course in linear algebra and while I don’t know what that is, I know it means that I’ve learned some high level math. And that leads to some strange biases, like believing that knowing math isn’t that important.</p><p>In my everyday life I don’t use calculus or linear algebra. Until I stop and think about it, I’d tell you that I don’t really use math at all. I’d tell you that learning math is nowhere near as useful as it used to be and that computers can do that work for us now. What’s the point in learning it?</p><p>But all my knowledge of math is making me forget what it is like to not know it. I can’t think like a beginner. This is the bias we all fall into when we know something well. It’s one of the stages of learning — you start knowing nothing, then you learn more and more until you know enough to be useful, and then master it. And the master doesn’t know how much she knows.</p><p>I’ve encountered this before but I only applied the idea to software development. I tried to start teaching someone programming. He had never been exposed to any programming concepts, although he was fairly technical.

By vision I mean that the person can see a future that is different than the way things are today. The person can imagine the way that things should be or at least the way that she wants them to be.</p><p>Without vision all the technical skill in the world is useless. You will simply be a cog in someone else’s machine because you won’t know how to use your talent. But with vision your talents are amplified. One of my greatest strengths is that my vision for how I want things to be drives me to learn new things and overcome challenges simply to see my vision come to life. What I know is amplified by the drive towards my vision and nothing can stop me.</p><p>So what do you do if you don’t have vision? Start looking for things that frustrate or annoy you. Can you do anything to fix them? No? Then look for something else. Eventually you’ll find one. Can you imagine a world where that frustration doesn’t exist? That’s your start.

I’d say no — our thoughts are private, precious, and thoughts alone cannot be criminal. But what if someone committed a terrible crime, a terrorist attack or abused a child? Would it be OK then?</p><p>I’m certain this technology to read our thoughts is coming. In the meantime, our phones are working to capture as much of our mind as possible so they can be ready for what we want to do. They read the context of the situation, like when I get in my car in the morning, and give me what I might need right then, like traffic information for my commute. Through every iteration our phones become more of a part of us (I didn’t come up with this idea, I saw it <a href='http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2016/02/apple_and_the_fbi_think_iphones_are_safes_a_philosopher_explains_what_they.html' title='here'>here</a>).</p><p>Yesterday, <a href='https://youtu.be/FhFibpHSJFE?t=1h15m39s' title='President Obama talked about phone encryption at SXSW'>President Obama talked about phone encryption at SXSW</a>. During his talk he made this statement:</p><div data-syntax=\"\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">&quot;And the question we now have to ask is, if technologically, </span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"2\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">it is possible to make an impenetrable device or system </span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"3\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">where the encryption is so strong that there’s no key, </span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"4\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">there’s no door at all, then how do we apprehend the child</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"5\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">pornographer? How do we solve or disrupt a terrorist plot?</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"6\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">What mechanisms do we have available to even do simple </span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"7\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">things like tax enforcement?&quot;</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>To which I’d respond “We already have this device.” This device is our mind and our thoughts have been private for our entire history. Having another impenetrable device, our phones, doesn’t change things. Moreso, it restores the natural order of thoughts being private.</p><p>So how does law enforcement work in this world with an impenetrable device? Well, they have centuries of history to look at for ideas. But I’ll go through the President’s talking points. For both the child pornographer and terrorist you look at inputs and outputs. Where does the device go? Who does it communicate with? I find the tax enforcement example particularly silly, but you enforce it the same way you do today, by requiring everyone to file documents and have penalties for not filing them.</p><p>One other small point which I’m not sure matters, but I’d be more OK with allowing mind reading if it could not be done without the person’s knowledge. Because that’s the biggest part of my fear — not knowing when people have been in my mind. A tool to break phone encryption wouldn’t leave a trace. You’d have no idea if someone had broken in.</p><p>So again, would it be OK to use mind reading technology? Would it be OK just for alleged criminals? Would it be OK for just the worst of the worst of them?</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/03-13-changing-what-you-want", "title": "Changing What You Want", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/03-13-changing-what-you-want", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>The things we want aren’t fixed — they change over time based upon environmental influences. For me the biggest influence is who I’m around. The social part of my brain kicks in and seeks acceptance through wanting or having the same things. Too many times in my life that has meant chasing material possessions. The kids I hung out with after high school wanted fast import cars so I put myself into debt trying to fit in.</p><p>Of course this social influence means it is really difficult for me to figure out what I want and at a certain point there is no way to tell the difference between what I want and what my environment has programmed me to want. I have no way of knowing what I’d “truly” want without those influences.</p><p>If you’re unhappy with the current state of your life it is probably valuable to figure out what you want. That may mean staying away from friends for a bit to let their influence wear off. It may mean stopping contact with those friends until you’ve got yourself firmly planted where you want to be.

I want my tools to do what I expect of them. I want to change things to make them fit into my vision. I definitely don’t want my tools changing things on me without my knowledge.</p><p>I know that my way isn’t the only way. I know that some people don’t care about as fine grained control. And I also know that the huge variety of tools out there for people to share their ideas and themselves is a wonderful thing. But it’s not for me. I want control. I want to see the moving parts. In the tech world, we call this “owning the stack” because we have control over all the parts of the thing we are building from the server to the database to the app.</p><p>To once again apply these thoughts to photography, which I will once again admit to not being an expert with, I see it as the difference between a phone camera and an SLR. I can take awesome photos with my iPhone but I can’t take the photos I have a vision of taking, for example a picture with a shallow focal depth that has me in focus and the background blurry. It’s the same thing I want when I’m making an app — I want to control the focus, lighting, everything. The iPhone doesn’t easily allow that level of control.</p><p>The desire for control factors heavily into every decision I make when I’m building something. And one of the beautiful things about controlling everything is that I get to make all the decisions. I know the consequences of them and what compromises I must make — do I want super fast page loading or super high quality images or something in the middle? On my server, writing my code, I can control that. I can’t do that on SquareSpace. If I build a site on SquareSpace and a user says it loads really slowly for them I don’t have a lot of options to fix the problem. That’s the downside of it being really easy to build a site. And that will work great for 90% of people, but it’s just not for me. I hate giving an answer of “no, I can’t do that because of the technology I chose.” That kind of philosophy has given the tech world a bad name.</p><p>Would it be too bold to say that my desire for control is a mark of a professional? I don’t think so.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/03-14-tricking-yourself", "title": "Tricking Yourself", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/03-14-tricking-yourself", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Today I was fixing the bathtub faucets that had been leaking for months and was remained of one of my particularly bad bad habits. Some water was leaking out of the hot water handle so I went back outside, turned off the water, came back inside, took apart the hot water handle, tightened something, went back outside to turn on the water, and then tested it once more.</p><p>Less water was leaking at that point but it was still leaking. But I tried to convince myself otherwise. I was wore out, tired of going back and forth to the water supply, and had other things to do. I almost convinced myself that I’d fixed the problem and that what I was seeing was just water left over from when it really was leaking. Fortunately I know I like to play this trick on myself so I look out for it and caught myself. I took everything back apart multiple times to get it right and in the end, after many trips in and out, I got it fixed.</p><p>I find myself most susceptible to tricking myself when I’m tired. I feel like I barely have the energy to do anything and want any excuse to stop. And then bad things happen. Like when I convinced myself that I didn’t need that seal on my car’s transmission that I was replacing the day before driving from Dallas to Fort Hood. By the time I got down there every gear but 4th had ground into oblivion.</p><p>I’m sure there are plenty more examples but none come to mind at the moment. I feel the temptation quite often though.

I see many techy people that want to explain how difficult something is, the risks involved, and how that something is out of scope from the rest of the project. That’s all important but if your goal is to ship a high quality product that reflects well upon you, which is my goal, then they don’t matter. If your goal is to make money then the “out of scope” part my be necessary but I’d argue not. We follow this philosophy at our company so we’re testing it in the real world.</p><p>We’ve been burnt a few times — greatly underestimating the scope of work which lowered my effective bill rate — by this philosophy because I don’t like saying no to ideas that will make the product better. I’m happy to say “this should be in phase 2” if appropriate but many times the product needs this feature at launch and we know it.</p><p>Despite being burnt, I strongly believe in my philosophy. It results in better products which reflect back on us, happy clients who don’t have to fight with someone about scope all the time, and a trusting work relationship with others who know “they’ll get it done and get it done right.”</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/03-15-self-destruction", "title": "Self Destruction", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/03-15-self-destruction", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Nothing and no one is more likely to ruin your plans than yourself.

It seems crazy to me, why wouldn’t a small business owner want to prioritize one of her biggest forms of differentiation — the fact that she is a person who lives in the community and cares about her work? She could be the antithesis to the faceless corporation. But for some reason she isn’t.</p><p>One reason I’ve heard is that small businesses want to seem larger than they are. Multiple small business owners have said that to me and I don’t know whether to believe their anecdotal evidence. Personally, I would much rather do business with a highly qualified individual running his own business than an employee of a 100 person business. I guess size doesn’t matter to me. Let me know <a href='https://www.twitter.com/davidbrunow' title='on Twitter'>on Twitter</a> how you feel about it.</p><p>Another reason I can think of has to do with website maintenance. If you have employees that leave then it could look bad to have them on your site at any point in time. And you have to have <a href='http://ShepherdDog.co/technology-services/index.html#website-maintenance' title='a way to easily maintain your site when that happens'>a way to easily maintain your site when that happens</a> or things will quickly look out of date. I get that. But being able to put a face with a name makes such a huge difference on an instinctual level. And maybe that’s the problem — the fear that if someone dislikes me in their gut the moment they see my face then I’ve lost a client before I’ve even had a chance. That is scary. But I doubt that my face — or your face — would have that kind of impact on any sizable part of the population. But if a potential client can’t see me then they can only judge the text on the page. And if my competitor has a picture then my text won’t stand a chance against a human face (assuming, as I stated above, that only a small amount of the population will dislike that human face instinctually.) Back to the point about employees leaving. Yes, if you constantly have different people on your site it will look bad. But it looking bad will be the least of your concerns because if that is happening then your company is in trouble anyway because you won’t have sufficiently trained employees. If someone leaves your company every once in a while then people might notice, but they all know that people change jobs. Hell, they might have even changed jobs themselves once or twice.</p><p>So what else am I missing? Maybe people think it is hard to take good pictures of themselves to put up there? Maybe they don’t want the entire Internet to get into their private life? What else am I missing? And is any reason good enough to not have your picture there?</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/03-17-overwhelmed", "title": "Overwhelmed", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/03-17-overwhelmed", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’ve been feeling overwhelmed a lot lately.

Any ambiguity will quickly pull a new habit apart.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/03-20-everything-can-be-copied", "title": "Everything Can Be Copied", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/03-20-everything-can-be-copied", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Everything can be copied and every day it is getting easier to do so. If you make a hit game in the App Store then someone, somewhere will make a clone mere days or weeks after. But this phenomenon — and really, compared to the world of 100 years ago the speed of copying really is like magic — is not only affecting the digital world. Through both cheap labor and 3D printing it is getting easier to copy physical products.</p><p>Of course copying isn’t new. Society has protections in place to protect against it like patents, trademarks, and copyrights. But many things can’t use these protections, like a hit game that combines simple elements in a new way or a permanent LED lighting system that uses new technology. Also, these protections don’t cross borders well so a copyright in the US doesn’t help protect against a copier in Norway.</p><p>For these situations I see two ways to protect yourself:</p><ol><li><p><p>Build a system that is difficult to copy and in which all the components work together, or</p></p></li><li><p><p>Build a brand that is trusted and valued beyond the obvious and superficial features which are easily copied.</p></p></li></ol><p>There is a third way to protect yourself, the primary one we are building our business on, but it doesn’t scale well. That third way is to make the business about personal relationships. When you work with us you get to work with us and no one else can be us. This means we bring as much of our personalities into the business as possible rather than creating a bland, liked-by-everyone big corporate brand. Our personalities are our protection. But this doesn’t scale well because we can only do so much in a day and past that we have to turn down work.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/03-20-urgency", "title": "Urgency", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/03-20-urgency", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>The leaders of the last two companies that I’ve worked for always encouraged us employees to have a sense of urgency. I’ve generally tried to be the model employee and live up to the ideals of my leaders so I bought into it. I approached each and every task with a strong sense of urgency. This also played into my tendency to ship things before they were ready and my desire to be faster than everyone else.

Stories like “I’m not a morning person, I never have been” or “Even as a kid I didn’t like to run and play so I’m just not meant for exercise.” These stories can be a great way to share information about yourself and a way to form bonds with others that have similar stories (more elaborate stories than my examples above.) But these stories are dangerous.</p><p>The stories you tell yourself reinforce your actions each time you tell them. They create an attachment between you and a way of being. They don’t allow you to be anyone other than the person in the story.</p><p>These stories are also loosely based in fact. We have a way of only remembering some of the data about our lives because our memories are not perfect.

My greatest fears are the unknowns and the greatest unknown for me is the future. It is so easy to let that fear take over and prepare a fear based reaction to things that might never happen. When I do this I throw myself into a future that I don’t have all the tools to handle. For example, if I try right now to live in my future that will happen in a couple of weeks where I’m trying to figure out how to handle taxes when I’m self employed and have almost no income (which I have no clue about right now) then I won’t have the tools of any research I can do on the topic or professional advice I can seek. I’m setting myself up for failure.</p><p>Here’s a question I came up with the other day that stuck with me, “Why would you want to live in that future?” Why do I want to put myself in a position where I can only fail like I described above? Or why would I want to imagine a series of worst case scenarios three steps into the future when I have no indication that step one won’t go smoothly?</p><p>Planning definitely has its place but it can quickly turn into living in a fear based future. Yes, if you have all the information you need (or all you’re going to get even if you need more) then go ahead and plan. I suggest you sit down and make a task of it, rather than letting it take over your thoughts while your doing some other mindless task like driving.</p><p>But if you are still waiting for information then let it go. Put it on your calendar or task list for later if that helps you let it go. If I’ve just submitted an iPhone app for review by Apple I don’t need to plan for the possibility of it getting rejected. I’ll handle that when it happens. Why would I want to live in that imaginary future?</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/03-25-difficulties-parsing", "title": "Difficulties Parsing", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/03-25-difficulties-parsing", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>On the second episode of <a href='http://brunow.org/podcast' title='The David Brunow Podcast'>The David Brunow Podcast</a> I talked about difficulties I’m having with my <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dharma-talks/id807331897?mt=8' title='Dharma Talks'>Dharma Talks</a> app. I’d like to follow up that discussion with some examples that would be hard to share over audio only.</p><p>The problem is that I’m having trouble getting the proper information from the Mission Dharma website to display in the app. On the surface, this seems like a simple issue of taking the information that’s on the website, figuring out which parts of it mean what, and then storing it in the right places in the app. For example, if I can find an anchor tag, represented in HTML as</p><div data-syntax=\"\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">&lt;a href=&quot;/talks/1&quot;&gt;March 21, 2015: Talk Title, Talk Speaker&lt;/a&gt;</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>then I can take the text inside that tag as the raw Talk data. In this example, I can find the date by looking for the colon and taking everything before that colon and storing it as the date. I can find the title of the Talk by taking everything after the colon, looking for a comma, and then storing everything after the colon and before the comma as the title of the Talk. The rest of the text inside the tag is the speaker for that Talk. The URL to download the Talk is the easiest part because it is the full contents of the href tag.</p><p>This seems pretty easy, problem solved! But not really. This is where the fragility of HTML scraping becomes a problem. This is why most people would recommend against HTML scraping and I would definitely agree with those people if there is any other, better way to solve the problem. Or if the system you are building needs to be 100% reliable. But most systems don’t and I believe that Dharma Talks fits into that category.</p><p>I’ll give an example of the fragility. Here is an anchor tag that I ran into while I was initially developing Dharma Talks:</p><div data-syntax=\"\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">&lt;a href=&quot;/talks/1&quot;&gt;March 21, 2015, Talk Title, Talk Speaker&lt;/a&gt;</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Do you see the difference? It’s subtle, but that comma after the year will completely ruin the parsing I described before. But while making the first version of Dharma Talks I’d seen this pattern so I adjusted my parsing for it. First I look for a colon, and if there is one then I do the parsing I described before. If there isn’t a colon then I find the second comma in the text inside the anchor tag and treat it the same as I did the colon earlier.</p><p>This worked for over a year other than a couple of minor issues where the person that maintains Mission Dharma’s website changed the text inside the anchor tag after the app had parsed it, resulting in two of the exact same episode. At that time I hadn’t wanted to limit the parsing to any sort of uniqueness because I wanted it to be able to parse things as generally as possible — I feared any restrictions would make it more fragile.</p><p>At this time the app only relied upon the Mission Dharma website being available for it to get new episodes. All the parsing was done inside the app and I had no control over what episodes were showing on someone’s phone. I couldn’t remove a duplicate episode that had had its title changed. I couldn’t fix a parsing error if the person maintaining Mission Dharma’s website didn’t follow one of the two patterns I described above. I liked the simplicity of only needing the app and the website, but I hated how fragile the whole thing was. I hated that my name was on something that looked poorly made. The line between simple and shoddy is thin.</p><p>Life got in the way and I didn’t work on the app for a year. When I did get time I noticed that I had taken a shortcut in building the app and I had hard-coded the years to be parsed. By hard-coding, I mean that I had told the app to parse 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. You can probably see the problem there. Hard-coding is bad and I know that, but I’m guessing I saw that as a very short term solution so I let it slide. That’s a good lesson for the future.</p><p>So I fixed the hard-coding so it looks at the current year and parses starting at that year all the way back to 2010 which should make that part of the app future-proof. I submitted the update to Apple, it was approved, and things worked. For about a week.</p><p>Up above when I was describing the ways the parsing could break I only talked about the text inside the anchor tag. That’s the nice way things can break. The bad way is if there is no anchor tag. For example, a simple typo could make this:</p><div data-syntax=\"\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">&lt;a href=&quot;/talks/1&quot;March 21, 2015: Talk Title, Talk Speaker&lt;/a&gt;</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Do you see the problem? The app would see it instantly and the parsing would break immediately. The opening anchor tag doesn’t have its closing ‘&gt;’ so it isn’t truly an anchor tag. This is what happened about a week after I released the new version of the app. New Talks stopped being added to the app.</p><p>I’d been thinking about having an application on my server that does the parsing and stores it in a database for a while. That would give me the control I needed to make sure that the Talks were loaded in the app correctly. Since the database was on my server I could change any entries that got parsed incorrectly. If things were too broken on the Mission Dharma site I could manually add Talks to the database. I could finally guarantee uniqueness for each Talk because I had total control of the data in the database. Ultimately, it meant that I could make sure that the information for each Talk was correct.</p><p>Why didn’t I do this a year ago when I first released the app? A few reasons. I wanted the app to be able to live on without me and without my server. I wanted the components to be simple. And I didn’t have experience with any programming language that I could run on my server. All my work had been on Windows servers and I had a Linux server. I still think these are valid reasons to make the decision I made, but if I had it to do over again I would have done it differently. I would have implemented the solution that I just did — a server application that contacts the Mission Dharma website for Talks to parse and an iOS app that gets the Talk information from that server application.</p><p>That solution went live today.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/03-25-insignificant", "title": "Insignificant", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/03-25-insignificant", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Tonight I watched the documentary The Look of Silence which is about an army revolution in Indonesia where a million people were accused of being communists and then slaughtered.

I had never read a book or taken a course in Objective C. I just wanted to wake up to music and my music was on Rdio. The app was a side project and a learning experience and I was proud of what I had accomplished.</p><p>Looking back, it was an amateur effort. It’s obvious now. But although it was imperfect, it was mine.</p><p>And it was a tool that I used every night and it worked. At least 95% of the time I was woken up to music. I have never made any money with this app, and I don’t expect to make any in the future. I couldn’t justify spending more time on it. And since I was so close to it, since I had designed and developed the entire thing, I really couldn’t see it being anything else than it already was. Four or five months ago I had decided that the app would be in ‘maintenance mode’ and that I wouldn’t do anything new to it.</p><p>Then I got an email from <a href='http://thoughtbrain.com' title='Jenni'>Jenni</a>. Subject line: ‘Love your app’. That sure made me smile. She wanted to know if I’d be interested in her help with some UI work. I was skeptical. Visited her website — wait, she does this for a living? And she’s actually good? I was more skeptical. Plus, I didn’t know if I wanted to put any effort into the app. Worse, I didn’t know if I wanted to work with someone else. I struggled with the idea that someone else could do something better than I could, and that instead of this being <em>my</em> app, it would be <em>our</em> app. It sounds silly to write about now, but I was in emotional turmoil. I can’t say I got past that turmoil quickly, but I decided to at least hear her out. <em>Turns out</em>, she also lives in North Texas. So we met for coffee.</p><p>Coffee went well. Actually, coffee went great — I was energized by just starting to work with someone else that is passionate about what she does. We seemed to have similar tastes in design and left the conversation with the idea that she would create a mockup and I could decide to go forward with it at that point. I drove home a little giddy.</p><p>About a month later, she sent a mockup. I really liked the design direction, but I wasn’t sold. I was still wrestling with my control issues.</p><p>But I like to think of myself as someone who won’t miss an opportunity because of my own insecurities, so I decided to go for it. And for the past two and a half months Jenni and I have been crafting Version 2.0.0 in our spare time — working together to make something better than I could make alone. Jenni is a joy to work with.</p><p>This morning, I submitted to the App Store.</p><p>As I said before, my first attempt at this app was not a professional work.</p><p>But this one is. This one is beautiful and functional and polished and I am proud to say that I took part in bringing it into the world. I can’t wait to share it with everyone.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/03-25-your-biggest-competitor", "title": "Your Biggest Competitor", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/03-25-your-biggest-competitor", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>In many industries the biggest competitor is non-consumption.

I’ll to talk through why I chose Magneto, the current limitations of my setup, and walk through simple tutorial for other ruby amateurs that may want to set up their own Magneto site.</p><p>The main reason that I want to use a static blogging engine is that I want to have complete control over my content. With Magneto, every part of my website is generated on my local computer. If the company that I rent a server from goes belly up, or the hardware server on which I have one small, virtualized chunk gets seized by the government, I could be back up and running on a new server with a different company before the DNS records could change.</p><p>Since I have complete control over the content, that also means that I can change the CSS and JavaScript directly. When using a drag and drop type tool that someone else created, I feel like I have to think through someone else’s mind. I don’t know their mental model for the task I am doing, so I have to figure it out before actually getting anything done. With Magneto, I just have to be able to read source code and think like me, and I’ve gotten good at the latter.</p><p>So why Magneto in particular? It is written in ruby and I was exposed to it through Don’s blog at the right time. If I had wanted to learn php, I would have started using Marco Arment’s <a href='http://www.marco.org/secondcrack' title='Second Crack'>Second Crack</a> long ago.</p><p>##Limitations Currently, I have run into only one significant limitation with Magneto. I am certain that I can build a workaround, but I haven’t thought about it too much yet.</p><p>Doing anything with my website while on the go, other than edits to content, is more difficult than I would like. And even edits require that my computer is on, connected to the internet, and watching my local directory for changes. None of those can be counted on to be true for a laptop.</p><p>##Getting Started with Magneto These instructions are based on my experience installing Magneto on my 2012 MacBoook Air running Mountain Lion. But I did it a little while back, so if you run into problems, talk to me on twitter <a href='http://www.twitter.com/davidbrunow' title='@davidbrunow'>@davidbrunow</a>.</p><p>Getting your site up and running with some custom design settings shouldn’t take more than a couple of hours, less if you know exactly what you want everything to look like.</p><p>###Prerequisites</p><ul><li><p><p>Web server - could be any variety since you will be sending it static files.

Navigate to this directory either in Terminal or Finder (if you have a version of ruby other than 1.8 installed, then the path will be slightly different):</p><p>/Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/</p><p>Look at the contents of that directory, and see if the following directories exist:</p><p>coffee-script-2.2.0\nkramdown-0.14.1\nsass-3.2.5\ndirectory_watcher-1.4.1\nexecjs-1.4.0\nmulti_json-1.5.0</p><p>If any of them are missing, run the following applicable commands to install them (since you are using the <code>sudo</code> command, you will have to enter your password after the first command):</p><div data-syntax=\"\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">sudo gem install coffee-script</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"2\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">sudo gem install kramdown</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"3\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">sudo gem install sass</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"4\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">sudo gem install directory_watcher</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"5\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">sudo gem install execjs</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"6\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">sudo gem install multi_json</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Magneto’s installation is just as simple as the other gems. You just need to run this command on your local machine:</p><div data-syntax=\"\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">sudo gem install magneto</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>That was easy, wasn’t it? Now let’s put some content out there.</p><p>###Website Generation Files Now, you will need to create the files that Magneto uses to create your website. The simplest way to start is to download all of the files from Don Melton’s website from <a href='https://www.github.com/donmelton/donmelton.com' title='github'>github</a> and then put them in a directory. I created a directory called ‘brunow.org’ off of my home folder. I think that something off of your home folder will be simplest, since you can use ‘~/’ when needing to provide absolute paths.</p><p>I started by trying to download as few files as possible. The upside of this approach is that I was able to see what each file did by seeing which features were missing at each step. The downside is that it took longer and ground my teeth a lot. But since I already did that for you, I will describe each of the files that you need and what they do, grouped by directory.</p><p><strong>~/brunow.org/</strong></p><p>The files in this directory handle the basic scripting of building the website as well as the overall configuration:</p><p><strong>Rakefile</strong>: this is ruby’s version of a makefile. In general, it is a script that performs certain tasks. In this case, it will start a new draft post, deploy files to your server, clean up folders and post a draft. You will need to make changes to this file, which I will describe later.\n<strong>config.yaml</strong>: this is a general configuration file for your website. You will need to change a number of values in here, which I will describe later.\n<strong>script.rb</strong>: I’m not sure of the most correct way to describe this file. Pretty much, it is the main source code file for the website. Magneto will read through this file, and generate posts based upon the files in the /Items path. This is the main component that uses all of the other ruby files to put all of the pages together.</p><p><strong>~/brunow.org/Items</strong></p><p>The files in this directory are either a template of each file that will be moved to the server for the website (about.md will become /about/index.html) or the file itself (/favicon.ico will become /favicon.ico in the output.) All content, such as the ‘About’ page and each individual blog post, is in a variety of <a href='http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/' title='Markdown'>Markdown</a> format called <a href='http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/syntax.html' title='kramdown'>kramdown</a> and when run through Magneto will be moved into its own directory and named index.html. Anything that will be generated by Magneto is in a file with a .erb extension.</p><p><strong>.htaccess</strong>: this is a file that lives on web servers to establish access rights to directories.\n<strong>404.md</strong>: this is the content that will be displayed when a page cannot be found on your server. It doesn’t follow the rule about being moved into a folder and renamed index.html.\n<strong>about.md</strong>: this is content about you. Well, when you first download it, it is content about Don. So you will want to make it about you.\n<strong>archives.erb</strong>: this is the template for the archives page of the website. This file contains both HTML and ruby. The ruby is used to group your posts by dates and display links to each of them in one location.\n<strong>favicon.ico</strong>: this is the image that will show up in the browser bar when someone visits your website. You will need to provide and image and then you can follow [John Gruber’s instructions on how to make a retina favicon].\n<strong>index.erb</strong>: this is the template for every file that will be an index.html, which is based upon the document.erb template.\n<strong>robots.txt.erb</strong>: this is the template for the file that tells the ethical bots whether they can traverse your site\n<strong>rss.xml.erb</strong>: this is the template for your RSS feed.\n<strong>sitemap.xml.erb</strong>: this is the template for your site map.\n<strong>css/style.sass</strong>: this is the stylesheet for your website, in [SASS] format. It will become /css/style.css after processing through Magneto (which handles running it through the SASS engine for you).\n<strong>includes/sidebar.erb</strong>: the includes folder holds different ‘components’ of the web page. This particular file the is template for a right sidebar that has a short bio, recent articles and search.\n<strong>js/jquery.min.js</strong>: the jQuery JavaScript library is an easier way to do JavaScript - it contains advanced functions that would be a pain to write yourself, and solves browser compatibility problems.\n<strong>js/timeago.coffee</strong>: this coffeescript changes the date at the end of your posts from ‘January 3rd, 2013’ to ‘Two months ago.’</p><p><strong>~/brunow.org/plugins</strong></p><p>The files in this directory are called by either the script.rb file or by the .erb files that build the pages. Each performs its own little part in the process of website generation, and has documentation at the beginning which I will pretty much restate here:</p><p><strong>copyright_year.rb</strong>: uses the copyright year information in your config.yaml file to determine how to display the copyright years\n<strong>image.rb</strong>: creates proper image tags\n<strong>items.rb</strong>: parses individual markdown files to create posts\n<strong>markdown_inline.rb</strong>: parses the markdown syntax\n<strong>reduce_empty_lines_filter.rb</strong>: removes extra whitespace\n<strong>relative_to_absolute_urls_filter.rb</strong>: changes relative URLs to absolute\n<strong>remove_more_marker_filter.rb</strong>: gets rid of the MORE marker\n<strong>strip_html.rb</strong>: not sure\n<strong>symbolic_to_numeric_entities_filter.rb</strong>: changes symbols like <code>&amp;amp;</code> to their numeric equivalent <code>&amp;#38;</code>\n<strong>video.rb</strong>: creates the proper video tags</p><p><strong>~/brunow.org/templates</strong></p><p><strong>document.erb</strong>: the basic template of each ‘index.html’ file that will be created by Magneto. <em>You will need to make changes in this file</em>\n<strong>page.erb</strong>: the template of the page that is inside of the document\n<strong>post.erb</strong>: the template for each post that will be on the main site page\n<strong>post_article.erb</strong>: the template of the page if it is an individual post, rather than all posts</p><p>###Customizing Magneto Now I will describe the small number of items that you absolutely need to modify to get Magneto running as well as those that you will need to change so that you are not copying the style of Don’s site.</p><p>First, open config.yaml in your favorite text editor. Change <code>base_url:</code> to be the name of your site. If you know how your CDN works, then put in the proper URL there for <code>cdn_url:</code> — I think mine is the same as my base URL, but I haven’t researched that yet. Change the copyright information to yours, and put in a description of your site. This description will be part of the document header if you use a template similar to Don’s. If you are going to be using Google Analytics, then change Don’s number to yours. I actually left Don’s GA number in there because I am not using GA and I got an error when running Magneto when I took out that line completely. I did remove all of the GA JavaScript from the pages, however, and will try to track down the source of the problem with removing that line in the future. Instead of GA, I am using <a href='http://www.haveamint.com' title='Mint'>Mint</a>. Why did I choose Mint? Because I want to own my analytics, just like I want to own everything else.</p><p>Anyhow, back to changing the config.yaml file: change <code>search_sites:</code> to your site’s URL, change the <code>title:</code> to whatever you want to show up in the browser’s tab bar, and change <code>visible_posts:</code> to show the number of posts that you want on your main and subsequent pages.</p><p>Now to the Rakefile. I don’t use the ‘stage’ or ‘deploy’ sections of the Rakefile right now, so I won’t speak to them. The one thing you need to change if you are going to be using the Rakefile for deployments is the part after <code>rsync</code>. You will need to put the information for the directory that you have your output folder in as the first argument after <code>-avz</code>. I use the absolute path because I have another process that calls Rakefile to make things more automatic. You will then need to put in the information for your server as the last parameter.</p><p>Ok, now to the customization of the look of the site. Let’s start in templates/document.erb. In here, you can change the names of the items in the header, add an image to your header like I have, or do other structural type tweaks. This is stuff that I can’t tell you what to do — it is time to make it yours.</p><p>So next, we will head to another area that I can’t tell you what to do: the css. I change a few things in items/css/style.sass, such as the color of the footer, the way that the site handles different screen widths, and hiding the sidebar.</p><p>Ok, you are just about ready, you just need to do three final things:</p><ul><li><p><p>Delete the directories for each year (2012, 2013, etc.) These contain Don’s blog posts, which you won’t need.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Edit ‘about.md’ so that it contains information about you instead of information about Don.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Replace favicon.ico with an icon of your choosing. Don’s face won’t represent you very well.</p></p></li></ul><p>###Workflow My workflow is constantly evolving and hopefully I can keep updating it here as I learn to use Magneto in ways that will better suit my needs. Like the furniture in my living room, I constantly tweak my workflow to try to make myself more comfortable and reduce friction — anything that I can do to make myself write more often is a good thing.</p><p>That being said, here is my current process:</p><p>I start a draft post with the command <code>rake draft</code>. This way, a new file is automatically created in the drafts directory with a current timestamp and a title that I provide. Since I have my entire ~/brunow.org folder symlinked to my dropbox account, I can then either edit the file in TextMate 2 locally, or use IA Writer on my iPhone or iPad. Sometimes though, I bypass all of that and just start typing in my Notes app on my phone. Then I can just do a copy and paste from my Notes app on my Mac into TextMate when I am ready to create the post. Realistically, the limitation of having to make posts on my computer isn’t a bad thing. It means that I have a higher likelihood of taking my time to develop my thoughts, helped by using a screen that is large enough to see meaningful amounts of text at the same time, which I find is better for editing and pruning my ideas.</p><p>So that I can make edits to existing files from anywhere, I have Magneto running in auto mode on my MacBook Air. When Magneto detects a file that has changed in the /items path, it will regenerate the site. I then have folder actions setup on the ~/brunow.org file. I learned about how to set up the folder actions <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/andreatagliasacchi/blog/osxautomaticsyncwithfolderactions' title='on this site'>on this site</a>. That action calls <a href='http://brunow.org/downloads/syncsharedfolder.scpt' title='a script'>a script</a>, which deploys the files to my web server with the command <code>rake deploy</code> and then runs the command <code>rake clean</code> which removes the output directory and all of its contents. As discussed earlier, <code>rake deploy</code> uses rsync to send your files to the server.</p><p>Since I am using the auto mode of Magneto I could technically start a new post on my phone, but I really like how it automatically handles the timestamp for me instead of my having to figure out the format once again and then typing the whole thing.</p><p>Once I have finished writing the post, I use the command <code>rake post</code> which re-timestamps, renames, and moves the files to the proper location for the site. Since I have Magneto running in auto mode, it rebuilds the site, and within about 30 seconds I get a Notification Center message that my files have been uploaded by my folder action.</p><p>###Future I hope to keep updating this as I get responses from other users, or as Don updates Magneto. A little down the road I hope to work on my fork of Magneto and my website and get them both up on Github so I can share any enhancements that I make.</p><p>I also am planning on using Magneto to create a static engine that creates a sort of “storybook”. But that is still just tumbling around in my head right now.</p><p>You should definitely follow <a href='http://www.twitter.com/donmelton' title='Don Melton on twitter'>Don Melton on twitter</a> — he has already tweeted about one blog post about how to increase Magneto’s efficiency and he has great stories about his years developing Safari at Apple.

For a long time that was because I didn’t know my product. One memorable example of that happened when I was selling used cars. I was on a test drive with a couple and the man asked if the moonroof had an auto-open feature. I didn’t know and said  that it did. And then he tried it. And I looked like a fool and my credibility was shot. That was embarrassing.</p><p>Now I have a very different problem — I’m afraid to sell things that I make. I don’t know if that sounds strange. I’m afraid to sell them for two reasons.</p><p>First, I know they aren’t perfect. I know them so intimately that I know all of their flaws and limitations. I know that one of my apps is deeply flawed because it is an alarm clock app that you have to leave open all night long. I haven’t been able to look past that flaw to sell it.</p><p>Second, I’m afraid. I’m afraid of someone not being happy with what I created and being angry at me for selling it to them. I’m afraid of the responsibility of taking someone’s money and the obligation that I feel that creates. I’m afraid of trying to sell something that I’ve put my heart into and the world not caring.</p><p>It’s much easier to hide behind the idea that I’m an artist and not everyone will get what I make. And to tell myself that the reason the things I create aren’t catching on is because I’m not even trying to sell them.</p><p>I’m terrified of the idea but I’m ready to start putting that hiding behind me. I make some damn good things that I’m proud of.

For example, putting a hole in your wall to hang something. You can pick up a hammer and a nail at a local hardware store for a very low cost.</p><p>In the bottom left quadrant are tasks that are more specific to your needs or that you may only need to do every once in a while. Because they are rare you are unlikely to have the perfect tool but because they are simple you can probably adapt one you already have. For example, here in the southern United States we don’t get much winter weather so I don’t have a tool for getting ice off my windshield, but a credit card will do the job.</p><p>The top right quadrant is complicated but common tasks. It is still easy to find tools although they are generally more expensive than simple tools. Due to the high level of complexity the tool must have more generic features in order to keep the problem common and to solve it for as many people as possible. But due to the tool being more generic, you must adapt to it. Most computers and software would be in this category. For example, if you need to send email newsletters you have a variety of tools available but you will need to learn the way they work rather than it adapting to your needs. You have to follow its workflow.</p><p>The bottom right quadrant contains complicated and uncommon tasks. For these you usually have to create your own tools. For example, if you’ve created a piece of hardware with novel functionality and you want to be able to control it with your phone over the Internet you won’t find an off-the-shelf solution. This is the quadrant I like to live in because I really like creating these tools for people.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/03-31-avoiding-harsh-shadows", "title": "Avoiding Harsh Shadows", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/03-31-avoiding-harsh-shadows", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>My environment seems to have a lot of control over my mental state.

With a daily running routine this difficulty may come in the form of thoughts in your head telling you that you aren’t making progress after just a week of running. With a training program you may start to believe that you just can’t learn what you’re trying to learn because it doesn’t feel like you’ve made any progress.</p><p>The time it takes to see your outcomes feels like forever when you’re in the middle of it. When our attention changes by the minute or second, the month it takes to see improvements from running every day feels like forever. The progress is slow, steady, and largely invisible.</p><p>Many people give up new things quickly because of these thoughts in their head. They are convinced that what they wanted at the beginning isn’t possible. They won’t ever get into better shape by running. They won’t ever learn that new thing because it’s just not one of their natural talents. They close down their new business because it isn’t ever going to take off.</p><p>Another group of people handles those thoughts differently but nearly as destructively. When she doesn’t see progress from running in a week, she changes her exercise program to lifting weights instead. And then a week later changes it to something else. She feels she has better control over the outcome. When he doesn’t feel like he’s learned anything in a week he tries something else, something closer to his areas of expertise. When the new business isn’t attracting customers they decide to go after a different group of customers.

It applies as much to going to war as it does starting a new habit — for the first couple of weeks it is fun and exciting and new to get up every morning and run.</p><p>Until one day you wake up and it isn’t fun anymore. You go from a tremendous high to a pretty low low. Then if you fight through and give it a little more time, things will even out.

Since then, I’ve only broken the habit once when I meditated in the afternoon instead of the morning. I’ve changed it so that it is the first thing I do instead of doing it at the vague time of “sometime in the morning”.</p><p>Around the same time I made a rule for myself that I’m not allowed to use electronics in bed. I still use my phone for an alarm clock, but beyond that I don’t use it. I had an awful habit of laying in bed and reading email, Twitter, and my RSS feed before summoning the energy to move. I’d spend a half hour just laying there.</p><p>Changing these two things in my morning has had a dramatic impact on how I feel about the day. I have a purpose each morning, something that is easy for any of us to forget, but especially impactful when you work for yourself.</p><p>I also noticed that my favorite mornings were the ones when I had one of the sessions from the Stanford iOS 8 class waiting to be watched. I would get a little bit giddy and excited before going to bed the night before. Apparently I really enjoy and look forward to learning.</p><p>In a strange coincidence, two weeks ago my mom gave me a book called “<a href='http://miraclemorning.com' title='The Miracle Morning'>The Miracle Morning</a>”. I put it aside because I’m reading a couple other books right now, but I picked it up two days ago when she asked if I’d read it.</p><p>I’m not too far into it yet — I wanted to write this before I read the whole thing and subconsciously stole all its ideas, but what I’ve seen so far is similar to this routine I’ve begun. The author, Hal Elrod, talks about how important the first hour of your day is for setting up the rest of it. If you spend the first hour of every day with a purpose and bettering yourself then those actions will spill over into the rest of your day. If you have a morning routine that you look forward to in the mornings then you will excitedly get out of bed instead of laying there as long as you can convince yourself to.</p><p>I’m not sure if I can recommend the book yet because it feels awfully “self-helpy” with all of the marks of that genre — promising everyone that with just one little secret they can get rich and be in shape, etc.</p><p>But I really like the ideas from the book that I’ve shared here and I’m going to continue to experiment with them. I’ll continue my meditation habit, find something to learn every day, do my daily writing, and possibly throw in exercise. I’ll write more soon about how that goes.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/04-05-pencil-to-paper", "title": "Pencil To Paper", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/04-05-pencil-to-paper", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>A few weeks back I was recording a podcast and I didn’t know what I was going to say going into it.

Most are harmless and superficial, but some are deeply ingrained stories that we’ve been telling ourselves for years. They’ve become a part of who we are whether we still want them there or not.</p><p>I recently recognized one of these thought patterns. The best I can describe it is that I have a way of blaming myself when things don’t go well even though it is completely out of my control. I get this sense of inadequacy, that I don’t belong, and that I don’t deserve to be where I am at, doing the things I’m doing. I feel like I’m just not good enough.</p><p>These little thoughts whisper to me throughout the day, usually without notice. They feel outside of my control like they are just part of the landscape. But now I’m aware of them.</p><p>Prompted by ideas in the book “<a href='http://miraclemorning.com' title='The Miracle Morning'>The Miracle Morning</a>” which I talked about in a <a href='http://brunow.org/2015/04/04/my-morning-routine/' title='post the other day'>post the other day</a>, I’m working to replace these ideas. I’m doing that through affirmations, which feel really silly. But now that I’ve recognized those little thoughts that are telling me things that aren’t true, I can see how affirmations work. It is simply a way to replace your default daily thoughts with upgraded ones of your choosing.</p><p>Today is the first day I’ve tried using an affirmation so I have no real data on whether they work. But they cost nothing, can cause no harm, and have an enormous upside. And in just one day I noticed a difference — my affirmation was randomly on repeat in my head throughout the day. I felt more positive than I have in a long time.</p><p>Try it as part of your morning routine. Repeat something positive about yourself out loud. I did it 5 times in a row but I don’t know if that’s the right number.

I don’t mean by lowering the standards but instead by lowering the total cost — in both time and money — as well the cost of making a mistake.</p><p>In particular I’m thinking of colleges and universities in the United States and how they prepare students for the real world. College costs in the US are high and continually rising. These high costs automatically exclude a segment of the population that has to decide to feed themselves or better their chances for success in the working world. Most people will choose to eat in that circumstance, it is lower on the Maslow hierarchy. If we can lower the cost to get an education for an industry then we should see all kinds of people in that industry.</p><p>Lowering the cost will make the process of figuring out “what you want to do with your life” better, but could use more improvement. Changing majors in college is difficult and results in wasted time and energy — we are encouraging students to diversify as little as possible in what they learn which I think is a bad thing. Any additional education, whether it is in a particular study path or not, is good for that person as well as anyone who hires them.</p><p>I have an idea of how I can help with this, starting small and seeing where it takes me.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/04-07-the-key-to-success-is-staying-alive", "title": "The Key to Success Is Staying Alive", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/04-07-the-key-to-success-is-staying-alive", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’m toying with this idea right now and I don’t quite have myself convinced about it.

He wrote a book with his life philosophies and “instructions” for the martial art he created called Jeet Kune Do. I put “instructions” in quotes because Jeet Kune Do is a formless martial art without fixed poses or motions. Instead it is fluid, like water, and can take whatever shape is needed during a specific encounter.</p><p>The beginning of his book contains pages of thoughts which stand alone and also guide the reader through his philosophy. I was reading it this morning and the quote I shared at the beginning stood out to me. I felt a deep understanding mixed with resistance.</p><p>The first resistance said “If I don’t have opinions then won’t I be boring?” I fear that a me without likes and dislikes will be like a smooth white wall, completely plain and dull. That fear is strong — it won’t let me picture that different me — and I’m not sure how to get past it.</p><p>The second resistance said “How do I support good causes and fight against bad ones?” As I sit here thinking about that I recall my time in Iraq. During that year I learned that what we see in action movies is nowhere near reality. Very rarely, if ever, do we encounter pure evil or pure good because most of this world is a healthy mixture of both. I also remember that the further we align ourselves with one side the further we alienate ourselves from another. From that far distance you cannot convince them to meet you in the middle.</p><p>I’ve made the quote one of my daily affirmations. Partially because I feel deep down that it is true, partially because I want to challenge myself, and partially because I haven’t figured out exactly what it means to me and I want to keep it on the top of my mind.</p><p>How does reading it make you feel or what does it make you think?</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/04-08-the-old-guard", "title": "The Old Guard", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/04-08-the-old-guard", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><h3 id='Problems-with-Involving-the-Old-Guard-in-New-Initiatives'>Problems with Involving the Old Guard in New Initiatives</h3><ul><li><p><p>In their infancy, new initiatives are too small for the Old Guard to care about — a thousand dollars or a dozen people here or there aren’t worth their time or money</p></p></li><li><p><p>The Old Guard has their own regimented way of doing things and can’t be nimble or agile in response to change</p></p></li><li><p><p>The Old Guard will want to do things their way</p></p></li><li><p><p>The Old Guard will want a prominent seat at the table due to their status, regardless of the resources they provide</p></p></li><li><p><p>The Old Guard is less likely to see the vision of the future since their day to day is solving the problems of today and their experience is in solving the problems of the past</p></p></li></ul><h3 id='Benefits-of-Involving-the-Old-Guard'>Benefits of Involving the Old Guard</h3><ul><li><p><p>Resources (money, people, connections)</p></p></li><li><p><p>Some relevant experience that overlaps the problems in the new initiative</p></p></li></ul></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/04-09-Checklist-Features-and-How-I-Would-Design-Mobile-Deposit", "title": "Checklist Features and How I Would Design Mobile Deposit", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/04-09-Checklist-Features-and-How-I-Would-Design-Mobile-Deposit", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>A <a href='http://www.marco.org/2012/04/06/photo-check-deposits' title='recent post by Marco Arment'>recent post by Marco Arment</a> prompted me to gather my thoughts on making deposits from a smartphone into your bank account. I have a healthy amount of experience working in banking, and some experience developing software, most of which overlaps the banking experience. I want to discuss how I think Chase implemented this feature and how I would approach the implementation.</p><p>Marco ended his post with “Sometimes, new technology is not progress.” I’d like to alter that slightly, to say that poorly implemented technology is not progress. I believe that Chase has implemented a “checklist feature”, a feature that a company creates to stand out in a direct product comparison, rather than to create something great for its customers. I figure that you will see these types of features in industries that are lower margin or maybe just full of accountants.</p><p>Personally, I cannot stand “checklist features” – I am too attached to things being “done the right way.” But, from anecdotal evidence, this feature is benefitting Chase quite well. I have heard that people are changing banks simply to have the ability to deposit checks in this manner, and my mom hasn’t complained about the poor implementation (other than the time that I had to explain to her that her deposit had been rejected, days after it was initially deposited.)</p><h2 id='Implementation'>Implementation</h2><p>Now, to the implementation – when offering a feature like this to my customers, I would be concerned about the following factors:</p><p>Identifying check information (routing number, account number, amount, images) Getting the check information to the Bank securely Ensuring that checks have not already been deposited Determining when to give the customer credit for the deposit Providing confirmation of the deposit to the customer</p><h2 id='Chase'>Chase</h2><p>From what I can gather, and I must emphasize that I have no first hand knowledge of Chase’s practices, this is how Chase implemented this feature:</p><p>First, they prompt the customer for the amount of the check.</p><p>Second, the app sends the images to the server without doing any image quality verification. (Why else would the check get rejected later?)</p><p>Chase seems to have combined the third through fifth steps. I am guessing that someone manually looks at each set of images and makes the deposit manually, and that this is why it would it take days to receive a confirmation. That long confirmation time could also be explained by Chase waiting to get the funds from the other bank before approving the deposit, but I hope not, because this is poor way of handling this problem. I am not usually an advocate of pestering a customer with confirmations, but when it comes to money, I don’t think you can give too many. In this case, give the customer two confirmations, one saying that the deposit is good and another saying when the funds are available.</p><p>In summary, in Chase’s implementation the iPhone is being used to digitally hand the checks to a teller.</p><h2 id='Brunow'>Brunow</h2><p>Here is how I would implement it:</p><p>First, I would have the customer take a picture of the front and the back of the check. On the iPhone, I would do some basic calculations to determine whether the image was skewed or too out of focus.</p><p>Second, if the images passed these basic tests, they would be securely sent to a server via HTTPs. The server would do additional image quality checks and then use OCR to determine guesses for the routing number, account number, check number, check date, and amount. The first three have a high likelihood of being correct, since checks in the United States all use the same font. The amount and check date would be more difficult, since it could be typed in any font or even handwritten. Therefore, after the check has been OCRed, the server would send the information back to the phone for confirmation by the customer. The customer would be prompted to change the information or confirm that it is correct.</p><p>Third, once this information is confirmed, the server would ensure that that same check had not been deposited in the past, in any account.</p><p>Fourth, the server would determine when the deposit would be available. In most cases, availability should be immediate. This risk rating would be determined by the customer’s account history, average balance, and how long the customer had been with the Bank. Monthly and daily deposit limits would also be put in place based upon this same risk rating.</p><p>Fifth, and most importantly for customer experience, the customer will be given confirmation before exiting the app, and will be told to write “VOID” on the front of the check.</p><p>In summary, the iPhone and the server work together to bypass the teller.</p><p>I’ve left out a lot of implementation details, but other things like not being able to connect to the server or deposit multiple checks in the same deposit are relatively simple to solve. And of course, to actually make my way work you need to know about Check 21 and x9.37 file formats, and have a good way of risk rating your customers, hopefully based upon historical evidence.

He made a comment about how you want to avoid state in your program because state is where the bugs are. I know he is a much more experienced programmer, but I can’t get my mind wrapped around what he’s saying enough to agree. I think that state is one of the best parts of programming or, more specifically, building systems that maintain and change state over time.</p><p>In my mind, complexity is where the bugs are. And try as you might you can’t avoid complexity for any reasonably sized project. You can move it around to different places but it is still there.</p><p>So the key is to make it as easy as possibly to reason about the complexity and to hold it in your mind. Which is similar to something Brent said — he prefers the straight forward, easily readable, and understandable version of the code more than a version that solves the problem “better.”</p><p>In all programming our minds are the weak link.

During that meeting I probably spoke out of turn, as I regularly do, and shared my opinions about the external view of that group and the fact that I wasn’t sure that I would attend another meeting. I said something along the lines of “we will all  decide whether it is worth our time to come to another one of these meetings and whether we get value out of them.”</p><p>As the last question of the meeting, Jack Kearney asked me what I would have had to have seen at that meeting for me to have no doubt about coming to the next one. I didn’t have an answer and told Jack that I’d think about it. Since the meeting I have thought at least a little about that question every day and I think I have an answer.</p><p>My answer is heavily influenced by what one of the ladies at the meeting (unfortunately I didn’t get her name) said on the topic of how to build a community. To paraphrase, she said that to build a community you get a really excited and engaged small group of people and then other people see that excitement and want to join and participate and the group keeps getting bigger that way.</p><p>If that is what I had seen during that first meeting then I would definitely be attending the next. I picture walking into the coffee bar, seeing a group of people excitedly chatting about what’s going on with them (I know that in this particular group we have a number of introverts, but introverts get excited too!) and then being warmly welcomed by that group as if I’d been part of it for months already. I don’t care what the topics are as long as they engage the group and the group is excited and wants me to be a part of what they have going on.</p><p>That isn’t what I saw in that first meeting. What I did see was one member of the group working really hard to organize the meeting and come up with topics but without effort from the rest of the group. So am I going back for another meeting?</p><p>Yes! Why? Because I see a group of people that <em>want</em> to be excited and engaged but just need to be pushed a little further to get there. And because I see the future of what this group will do for our bigger community of Denton.</p><p>I see the vision of why this group exists and I want to share that vision.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/04-14-constantly-researching", "title": "Constantly Researching", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/04-14-constantly-researching", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I think you can learn a lot by asking “why” in everyday conversations.

They usually don’t account for human nature and the bumps that life provides to us all.</p><p>An example of this is the tree policy that many cities have these days. I know, tree policy? Why am I reading about a tree policy?</p><p>Anyhow, many cities have a policy of not planting similar species of trees next to each other[^1]. The main reason for this is that if a pest that affects just one species of tree invades then all the city’s trees won’t be wiped out. Sounds like a great plan.</p><p>But then the human nature kicks in. And humans find it difficult to replace just one tree because a pest killed it. After all, there are four other trees right near by that are all healthy. No need to replace that one!</p><p>What ends up happening is that the city’s tree coverage slowly dwindles until it is next to nothing and someone finally notices after the benefits of the trees have been lost for years.</p><p>The optimal, logical solution to a problem doesn’t work with human nature.</p><p>I don’t think that anything designed for human use or with humans involved should be designed solely for efficiency. It should be designed for human nature, and in particular the nature of the humans that will be using it. What happens when the economy is bad, will a tree be replaced? What happens when your app’s user is tired, will they find a shortcut for the process?</p><p>Make plans for real life and real people.</p><p>[^1]:All the information about trees and city planning that I’m including here is based upon reading “Walkable City: How Downtown Can Save America, One Step at a Time” by Jeff Speck several months ago.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/04-15-a-cover-letter", "title": "A Cover Letter", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/04-15-a-cover-letter", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I wrote a cover letter for a job application last night and marveled at how easy it was.

Part of me wants to keep a tight hold on it. While I want this new thing to exist and don’t care if someone else makes it before me, I want the best possible version of it to exist and I know I can create that while you might make something compromised. I’m also really excited about working on this particular problem and I don’t want you to take that away from me.</p><p>But I recognize those thoughts and I can let them go. So why am I not sharing this project with you yet?</p><p>Because I don’t want to create an obligation yet. This exciting new project can only be a side project right now because I have no guarantee that we will ever make any money from it, and I have bills to pay. So I don’t know how long it will be before I get to devote meaningful time to it. If I tell you about it now you will probably want to know how it is coming along next month and I’ll feel an implicit obligation to share progress with you.</p><p>And from experience, I find it very difficult to share a vision for a project with others. A few people will see the vision immediately but the vast majority just won’t. You have to show them something — you have to put it in their hands.</p><p>Over the next few months I’ll be working on something to hold in my hand and then I’ll be happy to share it with the world.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/04-16-my-concerns-with-creating-identities", "title": "My Concerns with Creating Identities", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/04-16-my-concerns-with-creating-identities", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Recently I’ve seen multiple examples of how identifying ourselves with a group causes us to separate ourselves from those who are not members of that group, including <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc' title='this video'>this video</a> and <a href='http://www.onbeing.org/program/jonathan-haidt-the-psychology-behind-morality/6341' title='this podcast episode'>this podcast episode</a>. We separate ourselves from our neighbor with our religion, political party, and even the cars we drive (or the cars we don’t drive if we’re part of the biking community.) This separation is necessary to strengthen our bonds with the communities we are a part of — part of belonging to them means that you don’t belong to others.</p><p>I’m writing about this tonight because I <a href='http://rodenfordenton.com/2015/04/lets-make-Denton-neighborhoods-remarkable/' title='read a blog post from a local city council person'>read a blog post from a local city council person</a> with one point that just didn’t sit right with me. He proposed a “neighborhood/district identity initiative” which involves naming, branding, and creating identities for our neighborhoods. To me this feels like just another way to separate ourselves. Yes, we’ll come together with our immediate neighbors but at what expense to our relationship with our neighbors across the city? I don’t want separation from either. I want to emphasize the things we have in common and set aside the minor differences. I definitely don’t want to add another difference just for the sake of it.</p><p>Group identities can bring us together and tear us apart. I don’t want to bring together my neighborhood at the expense of my city.

That’s part of playing a long term game.</p><p>We would probably have more money in the bank account right now if our goal was solely to make money. We’d have different policies — for example, we would ask for payments during our at the beginning of projects rather than waiting until the end. We also would change our pricing so that we got paid for all the hours we worked rather than using fixed bids.</p><p>In addition to having different policies, we’d negotiate harder. If we knew someone was in a tight spot we might “play hardball” and negotiate for a much higher rate or other benefits.</p><p>But on the flip side, we may have the clients we have because of our policies and the fact that those policies embody who we are and what we believe. We had one client say that he wanted to work with us to help us succeed.

I’m not actively working on it and have no plans to do so at this time. I haven’t done research on it in a while so someone might already be pursuing it.</p><p>So here’s the idea — a closet inventory management system that tracks what you wear, the last time you wore it, how often you wear it, and allows you to share as much or as little of that information with friends and followers.</p><p>I think we are coming up on the time when this idea is starting to be feasible. The biggest hurdle is “How do I allow users to track this information in a way that isn’t awful?” Very few users are going to want to put their entire closet into an app. Very few users are going to remember to input each piece of their outfit into the app daily. These are the problems that calorie tracking apps face also. But I think that either RFID or Bluetooth LE can fix these problems. Unlike food, either RFID or Bluetooth LE tags can be embedded into clothing by sewing them into a tag or part of the stitching. The app would need to be smart enough to know what you are wearing simply by seeing what tags are close to it.</p><p>I’d try to build it as a free service — forever free to the users. To get started I’d want to go to people’s closets and add these tags to all their clothing and build up the database of clothing. It would be a very manual and non-scalable process to start.</p><p>At the same time I’d be selling the idea to the clothing brands. I’d say “Look at all this data we can collect about your customers. Look at how easily they can share exactly what their wearing — down to the item number — with their friends. I’d charge them a monthly fee for access to incoming data. I’d ask them to embed the RFID or Bluetooth LE tags in their clothes. They’d bear that cost as a marketing expense.</p><p>So what do you think? Have you heard of someone already building this? Does this seem like a good idea? Does the thought of making it excite you?</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/04-19-pacing-myself", "title": "Pacing Myself", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/04-19-pacing-myself", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Last Friday I started a project with a silly short timeline — building an iOS app in 2 weeks.

First is the building phase where I put all the design elements together and lay them out close to the design but not precisely. During this phase I’m concentrating on functionality and making things work rights so the design isn’t the priority. I also find that after working on the functionality for 15 hours over two days that I don’t have the energy or perspective to get the design right. My perspective I mean that I’m too close to it from looking at it so long and I wouldn’t know whether it was right or wrong.</p><p>The next phase is the polish phase.

The CI supported the main customer-facing app, which was modularized with each module living in its own repo. This meant that we needed our CI architecture to support many repos. Since CI architecture wasn’t my primary responsibility (I was a senior iOS developer on a platform team), I also needed the system to be easily maintained from as few places as possible – I really did not want to update every module repo every time we wanted to add new functionality to our CI pipelines.</p><p>My solution was to have the bare minimum of CI infrastructure in the repos and have everything else living in a separate repo which could be cloned during the CI job. When I first implemented this at my previous employer we were using GitHub Enterprise for our source control platform and Jenkins for CI, so that meant that every repo had a Jenkinsfile but nothing else related to CI. When I migrated the team from GitHub Enterprise to the hosted GitHub and switched CI to GitHub Actions, every repo had a yaml file defining their actions but nothing else related to CI. In both of these situations, updating the Jenkinsfiles or GitHub Actions yaml files across modules was painful, but it was also rare.</p><p>When I started working at my current employer, they already had a similar app architecture that was modularized with each module in a separate repo. At that time, we were using a hosted BitBucket instance for our source control platform and Jenkins for CI so I implemented a similar pattern to what I had at my previous employer – each repo only had a Jenkinsfile in it and all the tools were hosted in a separate repo. Then when I migrated the team to a hosted GitLab instance, I was able to build things in such a way that each repo had no references to CI in the codebase – instead, the settings for each repo point to a centralized configuration file in that same separate repo that holds the rest of the CI tooling.</p><p>The current state of our CI architecture is working really well for us, so in this post I’d like to share one bit that I think is critical – this separate repo of CI tooling that provides everything a repo needs to run its CI jobs.</p><h2 id='The-CI-Tooling-Repository'>The CI Tooling Repository</h2><h3 id='What-It-Is'>What It Is</h3><p>The CI Tooling repository is simply another repo that holds all the tools needed for CI, with only two things that make it work differently from other repos:</p><ul><li><p><p>The repository does not use the main branch, instead it uses a branch per supported platform</p></p></li><li><p><p>The repository knows how to “unpack” itself so that its contents get put in the right places</p></p></li></ul><p>Let’s talk through each of those in more detail.</p><h4 id='Branch-per-Supported-Platform'>Branch per Supported Platform</h4><p>When I say “supported platform” here, I mean the type of thing being built. For example, at my current employer the CI infrastructure I’ve built supports both our Android app and our apps for Apple platforms (iOS, watchOS, and macOS command line tools). Therefore, our CI Tooling repo has two primary branches, <code>apple</code> for Apple platforms, and <code>android</code> for the Android app.</p><p>When we want to make improvements to our Apple CI, we create a branch off of our <code>apple</code> branch, do the work, and create a merge request back into the <code>apple</code> branch. This does mean some duplicated work at times – some things we do on CI are common across platforms, like tagging releases – but my current stance is that that duplicated work is less effort and less error-prone than putting all our tooling together onto one branch. We’re also looking into ways to abstract out some of that duplicated work.</p><aside class='note'><p class='label'>Note</p><p><p>In reality, our naming at my current employer is not quite this simple at the moment because I thought it would be useful to have more specific branch naming. The branch name we use for Apple platforms is currently <code>apple/xcode14-dangerSwiftLint-dangerSwiftFormat</code> – I thought that including the capabilities enabled by the branch in the branch name would be useful but it simply made things more complicated while providing no benefit.</p><p>We’ll be moving to simpler names in the near future which is why I feel OK putting this in a note rather than inline above.</p></p></p></aside><h4 id='Unpacking-the-CI-Tooling'>Unpacking the CI Tooling</h4><p>For maximum flexibility, it is really useful for the CI tooling repo to know how to put its tools in the right place. One example is the Dangerfile – it must be in the root of the repo on which you want to run Danger. But maintaining a separate Dangerfile in every repo when you have tens of repos is unwieldy. It is much simpler to have a single Dangerfile in the CI tooling repo which can then be placed in the right place when unpacked. And it is much more flexible for the CI Tooling repo to own that unpacking so that its contents can be re-organized, or new contents can be added, without anything outside the repo needing to be changed.</p><p>To do that, the CI tooling repo needs a script which I like to call <code>unpack.sh</code>. This script does two main things:</p><ol><li><p><p>Deletes the .git folder from the checked-out CI tooling repo so any git operations will be performed on the repo where the CI job is being run, and</p></p></li><li><p><p>Puts files where they are needed for CI to function properly</p></p></li></ol><p>An <code>unpack.sh</code> that moves a Dangerfile.swift to the right place could look like this:</p><div data-syntax=\"sh\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">#! /bin/sh</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"2\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\"></span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"3\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">rm -rf $(dirname &quot;$0&quot;)/.git</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"4\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\"></span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"5\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\"># Move things out of the CI-Tooling repo here</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"6\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">mv $(dirname &quot;$0&quot;)/Dangerfile.swift $(dirname &quot;$0&quot;)/..</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h3 id='What-Tools-We-Keep-In-It'>What Tools We Keep In It</h3><p>These are the kinds of tools I like to keep in the CI Tooling repo:</p><ul><li><p><p>Danger Swift pre-built binaries, both executable and library</p></p></li><li><p><p>Dangerfile</p></p></li><li><p><p>Pre-built Swift tool to parse formatted commits</p></p></li><li><p><p>Pre-built swiftlint binary</p></p></li><li><p><p>Pre-built Swift tool to show public API diffs</p></p></li><li><p><p>Fastlane files (Fastfile and Matchfile)</p></p></li><li><p><p>Any other pre-built binaries or tools that are only used on CI</p></p></li></ul><h3 id='What-We-Do-Not-Keep-In-It'>What We Do Not Keep In It</h3><p>There are some things that we want in common across all our modules that we do not keep in CI Tooling. The determinant for this is whether developers need to use those things locally as well, such as configuration files for SwiftLint and Swift Format. We want our developers to get warnings and errors from those tools early, in their IDE, so we need those configurations inside the module repos rather than being in CI Tooling.</p><h3 id='How-to-Use-It'>How to Use It</h3><p>Using this repo is fairly simple – clone the repo with a depth of 1 to only clone the last commit, run the <code>unpack.sh</code> script, and then use the tools within the repo as you would in any other script. For example:</p><div data-syntax=\"sh\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">...</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"2\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">git clone https://www.github.com/DavidBrunow/CI-Tooling.git --depth 1</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"3\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">./CI-Tooling/unpack.sh</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"4\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">fastlane run_tests</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"5\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">...</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h3 id='Keys-to-Success'>Keys to Success</h3><p>The biggest key to success is ensuring that you have consistency across your different repos. This means having a standard folder structure, standard tools used, code quality standards, and one module per repo. A bonus side effect of this approach is that humans love consistency as well – it will be easier for your team to work within consistent repos than it would be if every repo follows its own rules.</p><p>But also, you will always have exceptions.</p><p>Sometimes it makes sense to special case those exceptions in your tooling. For example, we have some legacy repos that we don’t want to use <code>swift-format</code> on because it would cause a massive amount of churn and we don’t see the value in that churn with the legacy code. We have chosen to special case those repos by testing for the existence of a <code>.swift-format</code> configuration file in the repo. When possible, I like to use something specific to the tool being used to function like a feature flag. For other situations, we’ve had to special case by individual module names, which I only do if there is no other way to solve the problem.</p><p>Sometimes it makes sense to have entirely different tooling for different contexts. For example, we have different CI pipeline definitions for modules vs. the main app – there are enough differences between the two that it is easier to maintain two different files, each with a clear focus, than to try to put everything into a single file.</p><h3 id='Example'>Example</h3><p>I’ve setup an example of my CI Tooling pattern in the repo for a <a href='https://github.com/DavidBrunow/swift-conventional-commit-parser' title='macOS command line tool that parses conventional commits'>macOS command line tool that parses conventional commits</a>.</p><p>You can see the “client” side in the <a href='https://github.com/DavidBrunow/swift-conventional-commit-parser/blob/main/.github/workflows/pull_request.yml' title='pull request GitHub action'>pull request GitHub action</a>.

Lines 7 and 8 give the shared pipeline permission to add comments to the pull request, which is needed for Danger Swift to add its feedback.</p><p>You can see the shared CI Tooling side for that action in <a href='https://github.com/DavidBrunow/CI-Tooling/blob/apple/.github/workflows/macos-tools-pull-request-action.yml' title='this configuration file'>this configuration file</a>. This file is more complex because it is doing all the work – the client’s file is only calling into this one. I’m not going to go through it line by line because most of it is specific to what I want to do on CI and might be a good starting point for you, but you also may already have all those bits figured out.

Therefore it needs to figure out what scheme to use for running tests, which it gets from the <code>xcodebuild -list -json</code> command.

This makes things more difficult to initially get setup but makes adding new clients simple and straightforward.</p><aside class='warning'><p><p>Do not use my CI Tooling repo – always have your own that is completely under your control!

It is difficult to get people and companies to “do the right thing” with no other incentive than it being the right thing.

Making things seem worse than they are and giving them a catchy name that infers how bad they are are ways to inspire compliance.</p><p>This kind of alarmism isn’t my thing. Maybe that’s because I’m the type that does the research to know what the real implications of a change are.

This provides an excellent developer experience where (most of the time) they can know whether a pull request is in a healthy state by looking at a comment directly on that pull request.</p><p>This connection between the CI build systems and the pull request allows teams to implement automated code health tools which can give quick feedback to about:</p><ul><li><p><p>Warnings introduced by the changes</p></p></li><li><p><p>Linting and code formatting errors based upon agreed-upon standards</p></p></li><li><p><p>Code coverage percentages</p></p></li><li><p><p>Any other information which can be automated</p></p></li></ul><p>Danger has two base implementations, one in Ruby and one in JavaScript. On top of that, there are Danger runners written in Kotlin and Swift which hand off the bulk of the work to Danger JS but allow for Dangerfiles, the file which define what Danger should do, written in languages that will be more familiar to mobile developers. I prefer to use Danger Kotlin when building CI for Android or other Java-based projects and Danger Swift when building CI for Apple platforms, because I find it is easier to get folks involved in CI code when it is in a language they use every day. It is also more likely that folks in a specific community will create plugins for Danger that you could find useful – folks using Danger Swift will be more likely to create plugins around Xcode and other Apple tooling than folks using Danger Kotlin would.</p><p>OK I think that is enough of an intro to Danger, next I’ll talk through the flexibility built-in to Danger through its plugin system.</p><h2 id='Dangers-Architecture'>Danger’s Architecture</h2><p>Danger is architected to allow for anyone to create their own plugins that can provide information to Danger which can then be shown on a pull request. I’ve relied on this ability to add plugins to add extra checks that are specific to our codebase, like a localization linter which ensured that Xcode’s command line tools could extract keys for localization. Out-of-the-box, Danger allows for these plugins to be dynamically included at run time which is a lot of flexibility, especially when using statically typed languages like Kotlin and Swift.</p><p>This plugin architecture is very clever and lets people get started with Danger quite easily. But it is a bit complex. Let’s talk through the moving pieces in Danger Swift, all of which applies to Danger Kotlin as well:</p><ul><li><p><p>The Dangerfile</p></p></li><li><p><p>The Danger Swift Library</p></p></li><li><p><p>The Danger Swift Runner</p></p></li><li><p><p>The Danger JS Runner</p></p></li></ul><p>Here is how they are all connected. The Danger Swift runner builds and runs the Dangerfile while linking in the Danger Swift library. The Danger Swift runner then uses the Danger JS runner to interact with the source control platforms (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc). Let’s talk through each of these components in detail.</p><h3 id='The-Dangerfile'>The Dangerfile</h3><p>The Dangerfile, <code>Dangerfile.swift</code> for Danger Swift, is the code file that defines everything that Danger will do when Danger is run in a CI pipeline. Here is a simplified example of a Dangerfile from <a href='https://danger.systems/swift/' title='Danger Swift’s documentation'>Danger Swift’s documentation</a>:</p><div data-syntax=\"swift\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">import Danger</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"2\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">let danger = Danger()</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"3\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\"></span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"4\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">// Add a CHANGELOG entry for app changes</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"5\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">let hasChangelog = danger.git.modifiedFiles.contains(&quot;changelog.md&quot;)</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"6\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\"></span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"7\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">if (!hasChangelog) {</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"8\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">    warn(&quot;Please add a changelog entry for your changes.&quot;)</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"9\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">}</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>This simple example checks to see if the <code>changelog.md</code> file has been modified as part of the pull request and, if not, adds a warning to the pull request letting the developer know that they need to update the changelog. Providing that feedback through this automation means that a contributor to a repo can quickly learn what changes they need to make to meet the standards of that repo. Plus, the maintainer of the repo can focus on things only humans can do, like making sure that the pull request follows their architectural guidelines.</p><p>At the beginning of every Dangerfile, the Danger library must be imported. Let’s talk about how that works next.</p><h3 id='The-Danger-Swift-Library'>The Danger Swift Library</h3><p>The Danger Swift library is what powers the different things you can do in a Dangerfile. The library is built with the core Danger functionality plus any plugins that you’ve chosen to integrate. The documentation recommends integrating Danger into your workflow by <a href='https://danger.systems/swift/guides/about_the_dangerfile#swift-package-manager-more-performant' title='adding Danger Swift and any related plugins to your Package.swift file'>adding Danger Swift and any related plugins to your <code>Package.swift</code> file</a>. This allows the Danger Swift library to be built as-needed with just the plugins you’ve defined and puts everything in the right place so Swift can find the library when running the Dangerfile.</p><p>I’m not a fan of this approach but I’ll talk through that later when I go through how I like to use Danger.</p><h3 id='The-Danger-Swift-Runner'>The Danger Swift Runner</h3><p>The Danger Swift runner is a fairly simple tool that ties everything together. As mentioned before, it runs the Dangerfile while also providing the path to the Danger Swift library. This could easily be a standalone executable, but in the recommended setup, linked above in the Danger Swift library section, the runner is re-built through Swift Package Manager every time it is needed to be run.</p><p>In addition to running the Dangerfile, the Danger Swift runner runs the Danger JS runner, which handles all communication with the source control platforms.</p><h3 id='The-Danger-JS-Runner'>The Danger JS Runner</h3><p>As mentioned before, the Danger JS runner is the common tool across the different Danger “front-ends” (Danger Swift, Danger Kotlin, etc.) that handles all the interactions with source control platforms. These interactions are bi-directional because the Dangerfile needs access to information from those platforms and also needs to send information to them for warnings, errors, and informational messages.</p><p>Strangely, I don’t see anything about how to install Danger JS, or even the need to do so, in <a href='https://danger.systems/swift/guides/getting_started' title='the Danger Swift documentation'>the Danger Swift documentation</a>. I prefer to install Danger JS through npm, which I prefer to install through Homebrew. Here are the steps to do that:</p><div data-syntax=\"sh\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">brew install node</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"2\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">npm install -g danger</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id='How-I-Setup-Danger'>How I Setup Danger</h2><p>Now that we know how all the pieces fit together, I’ll gripe about the things I don’t like about this approach and talk about how I like to set things up.</p><h3 id='Gripes'>Gripes</h3><p>All of my gripes revolve around the need to use Swift Package Manager to build and run the runner and library:</p><ul><li><p><p>I don’t like to mix tooling and my app’s dependencies</p></p></li><li><p><p>I don’t always want to use SPM</p></p></li><li><p><p>I don’t want to re-build Danger on every run</p></p></li><li><p><p>The recommended approach is invasive to my project, requiring me to add a folder that will not be used</p></p></li><li><p><p>Due to the invasive nature of the recommended approach, applying the same Danger configurations across multiple repos, and keeping those configurations in sync, it creates a lot of manual overhead</p></p></li><li><p><p>I like pre-built binaries</p></p></li></ul><p>What I want is a pre-built executable for the Danger Swift runner, and a pre-built framework for the Danger Swift library. Let’s talk about how I make that work.</p><h3 id='My-Setup'>My Setup</h3><aside class='note'><p class='label'>Note</p><p><p>This setup requires a fork of Danger Swift.</p></p></p></aside><h4 id='The-Runner'>The Runner</h4><p>The Danger Swift runner is already meant to be a standalone executable, so we don’t need to do too much there. We want to make sure that it is built as a universal binary so it can run on both Apple Silicon and Intel, so we can build it like this:</p><div data-syntax=\"sh\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">swift build -c release --arch arm64 --arch x86_64</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Swift builds the <code>danger-swift</code> binary and puts it in the “.build/apple/Products/Release/danger-swift” folder so we’ll need to copy it from there to where we need it. All of that is simple and straightforward.</p><h4 id='The-Library'>The Library</h4><p>Building the library in a portable way isn’t quite as nice, but we’ll get to that in a moment. First, since we want a portable library that can be used anywhere, we need to find a way to build that library with all the plugins we need. This approach requires choosing your plugins ahead of time and not being able to do so at run time – if you want a new plugin you’ll need to rebuild and redistribute the library.</p><h5 id='Integrating-Plugins'>Integrating Plugins</h5><p>Fortunately, Danger Swift has already gone through the process of integrating a common plugin, SwiftLint, into the library so we can follow the maintainer’s lead and do the same thing for our plugins. There is already a “Plugins” folder in the “Sources/Danger” folder and adding our plugin there is quite simple – we copy the source code folder into the “Plugins” folder and then make whatever changes are need to make the Danger library successfully compile again. Doing that requires fixing any naming conflicts and, while we’re in there, we’ll fix warnings around importing Danger by removing any <code>import Danger</code> code. Let’s walk through an example with a popular plugin, <a href='https://github.com/f-meloni/danger-swift-coverage' title='DangerSwiftCoverage'>DangerSwiftCoverage</a>, which gathers code coverage so it can be posted on pull requests.</p><ol><li><p><p>Fork Danger Swift and clone the fork to your machine</p></p></li><li><p><p>Clone DangerSwiftCoverage to your machine</p></p></li><li><p><p>Copy the “Sources/DangerSwiftCoverage” folder from DangerSwiftCoverage into the “Sources/Danger/Plugins” folder in Danger Swift. If you cloned the two repos next to each other, the copy command from the root of the Danger Swift repo would look like this:</p></p></li></ol><div data-syntax=\"sh\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">cp -r ../danger-swift-coverage/Sources/DangerSwiftCoverage Sources/Danger/Plugins</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<ol><li><p><p>Open Danger Swift’s Package.swift in Xcode and try to build the Danger library.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Follow the compiler errors to fix all the build issues around multiple files and types with conflicting names:</p><ol><li><p><p>Rename the file “Sources/Danger/DangerSwiftCoverage/Models/Report.swift” to “Sources/Danger/DangerSwiftCoverage/Models/DangerSwiftCoverageReport.swift”</p></p></li><li><p><p>Rename the <code>File</code> struct on line 34 of “XcodeBuildCoverage.swift” to <code>XcodeBuildCoverageFile</code> and update the type of <code>files</code> on line 26 of the same file to use the <code>XcodeBuildCoverageFile</code> type.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Remove the <code>import Danger</code> from the top of the “XcodeBuildCoverage.swift” file.</p></p></li></ol></p></li></ol><p>OK, now we’ve integrated a plugin directly into the Danger library which means that plugin will always be available in our Dangerfiles when linking against a pre-built version of the library.

The reason is that the <code>swift build</code> command will not create a framework like we’re used to working with on iOS. Instead, it creates a folder full of object, .swiftmodule, and .dylib files:</p><div data-syntax=\"sh\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">$ ls .build/apple/Products/Release                 </span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"2\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">Danger-Swift.o                          Danger_Swift.swiftmodule    RunnerLib.o</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"3\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">Danger.o                                Logger.o                    RunnerLib.swiftmodule</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"4\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">Danger.swiftmodule                      Logger.swiftmodule          Version.o</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"5\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">DangerDependenciesResolver.o            OctoKit.o                   Version.swiftmodule</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"6\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">DangerDependenciesResolver.swiftmodule  OctoKit.swiftmodule         danger-swift</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"7\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">DangerFixtures.o                        PackageFrameworks           danger-swift.dSYM</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"8\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">DangerFixtures.swiftmodule              RequestKit.o                libDanger.dylib</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"9\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">DangerShellExecutor.o                   RequestKit.swiftmodule      libDanger.dylib.dSYM</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"10\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">DangerShellExecutor.swiftmodule         Runner.swiftmodule</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>This is not very portable. We need almost all of these files to be able to link against libDanger.dylib. Plus, these files are tied to a specific Swift version because <a href='https://www.swift.org/blog/library-evolution/' title='library evolution'>library evolution</a> is not turned on. This means that when you change the default version of Xcode on a machine, and therefore change the default version of Swift, you’ll need to rebuild the Danger Swift library. I’ve worked around this in the past by keeping an older version of Xcode on the build machines that is only used to run Danger Swift, but it is easy to forget why you’re doing that and inadvertently break things.</p><aside class='note'><p class='label'>Note</p><p><p>It might be possible to use library evolution with this libDanger.dylib and the object files, but I was not able to make it work.</p></p></p></aside><p>To get a framework, which I find to be much more portable, you must use an Xcode project file, which I’ve added on this <a href='https://github.com/danger/swift/pull/579' title='proof of concept pull request for showing how to have a pre-built library that uses library evolution'>proof of concept pull request for showing how to have a pre-built library that uses library evolution</a>. That pull request also changes the Danger Swift library’s imports to be <a href='https://forums.swift.org/t/update-on-implementation-only-imports/26996' title='@_implementationOnly'><code>@_implementationOnly</code></a> imports which tells the linker that the symbols within those imports won’t be exposed publicly. And finally, that pull request tells the Danger Swift runner to look for a “Danger.framework” to link against when running the Dangerfile.</p><p>Once that is done, you can run this command to generate the framework:</p><div data-syntax=\"sh\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">xcodebuild archive -project Danger.xcodeproj \\</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"2\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  -scheme Danger -sdk macosx -destination &quot;generic/platform=macOS&quot; \\</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"3\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  -archivePath &quot;archives/Danger.framework&quot;</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>I’ve added a <a href='https://github.com/danger/swift/pull/579/files#diff-ee93d24b11504c134791a4e4232fc7ccb850be02de509fd76431a30509bf675e' title='shell script on that pull request that builds both the runner and the library'>shell script on that pull request that builds both the runner and the library</a>.</p><h3 id='Using-this-Setup'>Using this Setup</h3><p>Now that we have an executable binary and a framework, how do we use them in our CI jobs?

It takes all kinds of people to get that.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/04-26-pointing-out-what-is-wrong", "title": "Pointing Out What Is Wrong", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/04-26-pointing-out-what-is-wrong", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>It is easy to see what’s wrong.

Due to that we seemed to be always getting in each other’s way which caused lots of picking at each other and fighting. The worst time that I remember vividly is that I knocked her to the ground by pushing her while tripping her from behind. (Sorry Laura!) While yelling at me, my mom shared her advice.</p><p>Sometime around then — this was 20 years ago so the order of events is fuzzy at best — my sister was being picked on by a kid that took the same route home from the bus stop. One day — let’s pretend it was the next day after my mom gave me the advice, you know, for dramatic effect — I stuck up for Laura and told the kid to stop. He got off his bike and got up in my face. Probably said something cliché like “what are you going to do about it?” So I threw my textbook at him, hitting him square in the chest. He left, and left her alone after that.</p><p>That incident reinforced my mom’s advice and it has become a strong part of who I am. But this advice extends past my sister and me. We all have to look out for each other. We all have to make sure we take care of those around us.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/04-27-seamless", "title": "Seamless", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/04-27-seamless", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>For many years I’ve heard the word seamless and known its meaning but I didn’t really <em>feel</em> it.

That means we can’t let the phone go to sleep and then have the app automatically open when it is time for the alarm to go off. That means that you have to open the app to set the alarm every night (or morning) before you fall asleep.</p><p>I knew about this fatal flaw when I started development on this app a little more than a year ago.[^1] I did research into different hacks that could possibly be used to allow the app to function in the background. At one point, I had decided not to make it at all since I couldn’t make it work perfectly. That’s what Apple does, right? They wait for the technology to mature before creating something half-baked? Well, I really wanted it to exist, so I built it anyway.</p><p>Fully knowing the burden of the flaw[^2], I made choices to allow setting your alarm every night to be as simple as possible. I added the ability for the alarm to start automatically at launch, so you only have to tap the icon to set the alarm. I designed the time input so that you can directly choose the numbers for the time you want to wake up, instead of scrolling back and forth in a picker like in a typical alarm app. And you don’t have to choose am or pm, because the app picks the next occurrence within 12 hours. With this design, choosing 6:30 am takes 3 taps.</p><p>I’ve used this app almost every night for the past year. I am constantly thinking of things that would make my process of going to bed and waking up better and adding those ideas to the app. I hope they make your nights and mornings a little better too.</p><p>I hope you enjoy our imperfect app.</p><p>[^1]: I’ve used a handful of different iPhone alarm clocks over the years, but I never stuck with them because of the friction involved with setting the alarm every night. [^2]: I stopped using this feature after Jenni’s beautiful redesign of the app. Now I actually want to experience the UI, rather than skip it.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-01-useful-experience", "title": "Useful Experience", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-01-useful-experience", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>When I was inexperienced I didn’t see the value of experience.

I initially thought “I have a lot of experience with that, that’s a great topic that should be easy to write about.” But the last couple of days I’ve been thinking about the stressful situations I’ve been in and I’ve struggled to take lessons away from them. I’ll try to stumble through the process of pulling out the lessons in this post.</p><p>As I said, I have a lot of experience with stress: growing up in a household that felt like a constant battleground, going through my parents’ divorce, getting kicked out of both of my parents’ houses, failing enough classes in college to lose my full scholarship, foolishly creating mounds of credit card debt and getting bombarded by calls from bill collectors, getting laid off followed by months of unemployment and losing my car and getting evicted, struggling to make enough money to eat, basic training in the Army, being deployed to Iraq for a year with a super stressful highlight of a rocket flying through the wall of the room two down from mine, fighting to prove to Army medical staff that the herniated disc in my lower back was a serious injury, assimilating back into civilian society, finding out my daughter had hydrocephalus, living in a failing marriage, taking on too many responsibilities at work and failing, my daughter spending a month in the neonatal intensive care unit, and my daughter having a seizure.</p><p>One effect of all those experiences is that stress affects me differently than an average person. I hit some pretty low lows early in my adulthood and everything else seems easy. But that isn’t to say that stress doesn’t affect me because it definitely does, but my initial reaction is to get calmer when everyone else panics. Looking back over those times I see different situations that have to be handled differently.</p><h2 id='Putting-One-Foot-in-Front-of-the-Other'>Putting One Foot in Front of the Other</h2><p>Many times you have no control over the source of the stress and no way to avoid it. You know it will end eventually but you have no way to stop it.</p><p>My most vivid memory of viscerally feeling this kind of stress is of standing in the hallway after the rocket hit our barracks. I had been laying in bed, reading The Art Of War before going to sleep. Then all I heard was a really big bang. Luckily, it wasn’t an explosion but just a rocket going through the outside wall of our building and bouncing off the walls of a room two down from mine. Then silence. I opened the door and peered into the hallway at the same time as everyone in the surrounding rooms and we saw the rocket rolling on the floor in the middle of the hallway.</p><p>We gathered downstairs while the bomb removal team took care of the rocket. I was severely shaken up. I had my arms wrapped around me — hugging myself — and my mind felt unstable. I don’t know a better way of explaining it than that. Then my mind came to a point where it examined the situation, weighed the options, and realized that I just had to carry on. I stuffed the experience down and locked it away. I just put one foot in front of the other, marching on.</p><p>The only way to handle that kind of stress is to focus on the next step.</p><p>This is a similar type of stress as college, where the best way to survive is to focus on the next class instead of the 30 you need to graduate. Like <a href='http://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/takingnote/2015/03/24/kimmy-schmidts-revolutionary-approach-to-pain/' title='Kimmy Schmidt says'>Kimmy Schmidt says</a>, anyone can handle anything for ten seconds.</p><p>Enduring these types of stress forge you — they make you who you are. I’ve endured long periods of this type of stress, and I think I was able to do so because I had the viewpoint of “that’s just the way it is.” Because things were out of my control, I was able to push them out of my mind and push myself forward. My recommendation is that if things are out of your control you should reconcile that early rather than wrestling with “if onlys” — if only I’d joined the Air Force instead of the Army, if only I were smarter, if only I wasn’t so bad at math.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-03-how-i-deal-with-stress,-part-2", "title": "How I Handle Stress, Part 2", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-03-how-i-deal-with-stress,-part-2", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Yesterday I talked about a good kind of stress, a kind that serves as a fire to mold you into a different kind of person. Tonight I’m going to talk about a kind of stress that feels very similar when you’re going through it, but has a negative effect on who you are.</p><h2 id='Stress-That-Makes-You-Angry'>Stress That Makes You Angry</h2><p>We all have different triggers that make us angry. Maybe you reacted to some of the things that I said I could let go of with the thought of “that would make me so angry.” I’m still struggling to understand all of my anger triggers but a couple of them are being told what to do and watching people do things in a half assed way. I don’t know why these make me angry, but they do.</p><p>I believe anger is toxic. If you’re in a situation where you are getting angry more than 10% of the time and that anger is causing you stress then you have to get out. You have to find a way to move on.</p><p>That kind of anger means that you don’t believe in some fundamental element of the situation you are in. It doesn’t mean that you are right to feel that way — there is no right or wrong in this, there is only the situation and the way you feel. Any judgments about right and wrong will only distract you.</p><p>The fundamental question comes down to “Are you angry a lot?” If yes, start planning your exit. If no, focus on the next step and keep moving forward.</p><p>I have always stayed in these kinds of stressful situations too long. I feel in my gut that they are no good for me but it is more comfortable to stay where I am rather than make effort to move elsewhere. That’s ok as long as you’re still moving forward. If you’re angry and not learning and not progressing in life then you need to get moving now.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-04-how-i-handle-stress,-part-3", "title": "How I Handle Stress, Part 3", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-04-how-i-handle-stress,-part-3", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>The last two days I talked about two different kinds of long term stress, the kind you just have to get through one step at a time and the kind you have to run away from because it is toxic. Today I’ll talk about the ways that I’ve tried to cope with those kinds of stress as well as short term stress.</p><h2 id='Get-Rest'>Get Rest</h2><p>Our natural tendency during stressful times is to sleep less. For short term stress, like waiting for lab results after your daughter had a seizure or taking care of your significant other when he has a high fever, cutting out sleep is the right reaction. Our bodies secrete the right hormones and hold back the wrong ones and prepare us perfectly for that situation.</p><p>The problem comes when our body responds the same way during long term stress. We sleep less and try to fix the situation more, for months or even years. The less sleep we get the less well we handle our sleep deprivation. We lose brain function and we lose our humanity.</p><p>When you are going through long term stress you must get your sleep. Cut out everything else first, although it’s really tough to do.</p><h2 id='Move'>Move</h2><p>Over a period of weeks and months those stress hormones will continue to build up in your body if you don’t move around to keep your bodily systems going. My natural response to work stress is to spend more time sitting at the computer and every moment away from it feels like a waste.</p><p>It is not a waste, you must do it. But not at the expense of sleep.</p><h2 id='Quiet-the-Self-Talk'>Quiet the Self Talk</h2><p>That little voice in your head will be your biggest problem. It will be telling you that you aren’t working hard enough, that you aren’t smart enough, that you don’t deserve to be where you are. When you get your rest it will call you lazy. When you find time to move it will tell you you are wasting time.</p><p>That little voice isn’t right. Listen for it but not to it. What I mean is pay attention to what it says and when it says something negative just let it go. Don’t fight it and don’t hold on to it. Just move on to the next thought or no thought at all.</p><h2 id='Find-a-Peaceful-Place'>Find a Peaceful Place</h2><p>Paying attention to those little thoughts in your head is a critical part of mindfulness. I practice mindfulness through a morning meditation habit and I highly encourage trying it. Meditation can be used for many things, but one of the main things I get out of it is noticing the thoughts that are going through my head.</p><p>It is easy to get caught up in thoughts while doing mindless tasks like driving to work or taking a shower. You can easily spend a half hour and have no idea what you thought about. But if you are intentionally sitting and trying to not think about anything then the thoughts that show up stand out more. And by the way, it is fine if those thoughts show up, that doesn’t mean you’re doing meditation wrong. Just practice letting them go again.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-04-only-seeing-the-worst", "title": "Only Seeing The Worst", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-04-only-seeing-the-worst", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>If you only see the worst in the world that says more about you than it does the world.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-04-solving-problems", "title": "Solving Problems", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-04-solving-problems", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>In software development you can’t truly say you’ve fixed a bug unless you can reliably recreate it before the fix and can’t recreate it afterward.

This time I want to approach that topic from the other side, discussing my process and how those tools, and some others I didn’t discuss before, fit into that process. My process consists of 3 main steps broken down into 12 total sub-steps, here is the first main step:</p><h2 id='Step-One-Do-the-Right-Preparation'>Step One — Do the Right Preparation</h2><ol><li><p><p>Make as few plans as possible before starting - I do most of my planning in my head with a sketch or two to help me work on ideas. Having fewer plans means you are less likely to get attached to any one way of solving a problem and puts the problem solving where it should be — in the creation phase instead of the preparation phase. This also works for me because I do smaller projects with fewer people. I do all the early versions of a project and then bring others in when I have enough created to have a discussion around.</p><p>The simplest of tools will work for this — I usually use eraseable crayon on a window for a dry-erase-like experience but a pencil and paper do just as well.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Understand the problem as well possible before starting - You can’t possibly know everything about the problem you are trying to solve before you start on the solution, but you should have a good handle on what it is. It is very easy to start trying to solve the problem before you know anything about it. Usually in these cases you will start with a solution to a problem you’ve seen before and not quite address the needs of the current problem. While your experience can be greatly beneficial it can also be a hindrance. If you don’t explicitly avoid it, you will try to solve every problem the same way.</p><p>The only tools for this part of the process are good questions, good listening, and a lot of time to think, both consciously and unconsciously.</p></p></li></ol></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-07-fear-and-complaining", "title": "Fear And Complaining", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-07-fear-and-complaining", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’m going to give an example of something I see in part of the tech community that I also see in other communities, such as spectators for sports or politics. The common thread is people who really care about the thing they follow, whether it be a company, a team, or a person. My example is about Apple and the passionate folk who want to give Apple advice.</p><p>Take a designer on Twitter saying that Apple needs to do something different with their design of iOS. Her assertion is that Apple is not showing that they are at the forefront of design with what they’re doing now. They risk falling behind and becoming obsolete.</p><p>Or take a software developer on a podcast that states that Apple software is really buggy and they need to spend more time on quality control. Otherwise they risk alienating their customers who will get tired of the bugs.</p><p>Each of these narratives is different but I think they come from the same place. Where is that? Fear.</p><p>The designer and developer are afraid that Apple will lose its edge and won’t have the cool technologies and ecosystem for them to work on. Or Apple will become irrelevant or fail as a company and they don’t want that because they love the company. The root of the fear is a lack of trust that the folks at Apple know what they are doing. These outsiders want to feel like they’re doing something — that they are contributing — so they do so by complaining.</p><p>Is it a good thing that they complain? It is productive in the cliche “squeaky wheel” way? I don’t know. Personally, I want Apple to have their vision for the future that doesn’t rely upon outsiders complaining. Of course there needs to be a balance between getting outside input and sticking with your vision but I think that balance should be heavily weighted towards the vision.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-07-my-rules-for-making-things,-part-2", "title": "My Rules for Making Things, Part 2", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-07-my-rules-for-making-things,-part-2", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>The first rule for making things was all about simple tools, a pen and paper, a marker and a window, and good questions. This second rule is where some fancy tools really make the difference.</p><h2 id='Step-2-Make-Iteration-Simple-by-Reducing-Friction'>Step 2 — Make Iteration Simple by Reducing Friction</h2><ol><li><p><p>Make changes easy — Use common editing tools that are easily accessible. Automate deployments to production so your changes get to users quickly.</p><p>We use a simple text editor as much as we can. We use <a href='http://gruntjs.com' title='Grunt'>Grunt</a> for deployments as simple as ‘grunt deploy’.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Make mistakes painless — Use a version control system that tracks every change you make. You will be able to track down code that broke things and painlessly undo those changes.</p><p>We use Git for our version control system. I don’t believe that any of the other version control options even come close.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Make testing simple — Have a safe test environment that replicates production. The easier it is to test the more you’ll do it and the better the products you’ll ship.</p><p>Our local machines mirror production perfectly so testing is super simple. We setup local web servers with Grunt that make starting the test environment as simple as ‘grunt server’.</p></p></li></ol><p>Of course, the specific tools you use for your workflow will have to adapt to that workflow. I have to change things up when I am making an iPhone app — I have to use a fancier program because the code has to be compiled. These particular tools are a good starting point for thought and discussion.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-07-shes-seizing", "title": "She’s Seizing", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-07-shes-seizing", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Last Thursday night I didn’t sleep well. My heart was racing and I was restless most of the night. Then I felt “off” all day Friday. Didn’t know why.</p><p>On the way to pick up my daughter from my ex-wife’s house I was anxious and uncomfortable. For no known reason I had a feeling something bad would happen soon.</p><p>I’d been driving for about 15 minutes with my daughter in her carseat in the back. She made a coughing/gagging sound and I looked back at her. She looked like she was spitting up some mucous. Her body was limp against the straps of the seat. I sing-songed “Emma” with no response. I started saying the ABCs, one of her favorite things to say back to me. Still no response, only more gagging, more spit up.</p><p>I frantically found a place to pull over, put on the hazards, and got her out of the car. She slumped over on me and continued to cough and gag every few moments, spitting up on both of us. I held here there on the side of the road, hoping I could help her get out whatever was causing her sickness. Nothing more than that mucousy substance came out. She barely had the energy to contract her stomach to cough.</p><p>After a few minutes, I gave up on the idea of her coughing up whatever was bothering her and got her back in the car. It was only five minutes back home so I decided it would be better to get her comfortable and laying down there. I called her mother to see if she had been acting strangly at all that day — no, she’d been acting normally.</p><p>I laid her down on the floor of my apartment, took off her clothes that she’d spit up on, and tried to comfort her. Her face was pale white and her lips had little color. She was breathing erratically. I was flipping out on the inside but tried to stay calm on the outside.</p><p>Finally, she spit up more than just mucous. Finally, she started looking better. I sat down next to her and she looked up at me. She was more responsive than she had been since she started gagging in the car.</p><p>Then her left arm started moving rhythmically. Up and down, up and down, up and down. I didn’t want to believe that something was wrong — I wanted to believe that she was comforting herself through that rhythmic movement. Then her eyebrows started moving up and down, then her leg, then her tongue. I got her in the car to head to the ER.</p><p>The drive to the ER felt like forever. Emma was limp in the backseat, her body moving beyond her control. When looking back at her at a light, I’d picture her smiling during bathtime — laying her back in the bathtub, with her hair floating above her head in the water. Then a snapshot of the enthusiasm with which she would look at me when I would start saying the ABCs came to the forefront. I almost lost it a few times. But I told myself “now is not the time for that.”</p><p>I get her to the ER, out of the car as she slumps over, still rhythmically moving. They take her to the back, put her on a table and start stabilizing her. An insensitive tech is suddenly standing next to me and states “She’s seizing?” I don’t know what to say. “That’s what they’re saying” is what I come up with. My daughter is having a seizure. I almost lose it again. I almost lose it so many other times in that ER as the techs, nurses, and doctor work to stabilize her. They do.</p><p>Emma was taken to a Children’s hospital and spent the next day there. Through the haze of anti-seizure and anti-fever medication, my daughter started to come back. She talked a little. She drank some milk. She smiled.</p><p>Emma is back to her normal self now. Her EEG showed that she had abnormal activity on the right side of her brain. We have no idea why the seizure happened or if anything triggered it, but the abnormal activity means that she’s more prone to future seizures than the average child. She’ll be taking anti-seizure medication twice a day for who knows how long. And like with everything else Emma has gone through, we’ll see how this all turns out down the road. It’s just one more unknown.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-08-at-capacity", "title": "At Capacity", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-08-at-capacity", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’m not good at knowing by limits.

By friction I mean the amount of effort that must be put in to get your desired result. There will always be some friction due to the need to communicate ideas but in my mind the ideal friction is as low as possible. In this ideal world everyone would share a vision and passion for that vision and push things forward together.</p><p>This isn’t what happens in the real world from what I’ve seen. What I’ve seen is groups within a company that slow everything down — 95% friction. Usually they do it with good intentions, citing stability or rules that must be followed. For example, take a bank compliance officer who sees her job as preventing the bank from risk by saying “no” to everything even slightly risky and who adds paperwork to every process to increase compliance. She doesn’t understand her job well enough because what she needs to do is say “yes, but” and put her energies towards streamlining processes while using her expertise to stay compliant.</p><p>The right way to avoid risk is not by saying no. The right way is to be knowledgable and work towards clever solutions.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-09-the-silent-majority", "title": "The Silent Majority", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-09-the-silent-majority", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I have part 3 of my rules for making things coming tomorrow — I’ve had a busy evening and I am getting to this post late and I want to spend more time on that one.

This rule is less about using tools and more about putting good processes in place, but I won’t be getting into the details of those specific processes because they will differ by team. The important takeaway is that you should be thinking about those processes.</p><h2 id='Step-3-Enable-Collaboration'>Step 3 — Enable Collaboration</h2><ol><li><p><p>Be able to integrate multiple changes seamlessly — This is critical to building quality software and to maintaining momentum. Without a good way to integrate changes, people will not merge their changes in a timely manner, changes will get lost, and you’ll find that the things you’ve already fixed are broken again. Not having that good way to integrate changes causes extra work and energy to be expended on tasks a computer should be doing, so your team will be spending time on that frustrating task rather than on the fun task of building cool new things. You’ll get less work done in the same amount of time and your team will be angrier.</p><p>We use Git to make our change integrations simple.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Make communication clear and open for everyone involved — The biggest hindrance to getting people to join in on a project is having to tell them all the background information about it. This can be limited by openly sharing all the information about every project so everyone on the team has a baseline understanding of what is going on. As a side effect, this improves morale.</p><p>Slack is the tool we use for this.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Use as few and as simple of tools as possible — Everyone on your team should be able to join in on a project without having to install any new tools. The best way to ensure this is to limit the tools you use and keep them simple.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Make it as easy as possible to add a new person to a project as possible (even if you have no intention of doing so) — This has two benefits. First, if you are running close to a deadline and need someone to help out quickly they can hop in without slowing you down. Second, making it easy for others to join in also generally leads to a solution that makes it easier for you to start over if you need, like if you want to move an entire project to a new computer or new server.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Reduce bottlenecks (don’t have one person be the only person for anything) — Having a bottleneck can kill the momentum you have tried so hard to build on a project and gives that bottleneck person one more thing to worry about when they are already falling behind. Don’t do that to them.</p></p></li></ol></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-10-thankful-for-facebook", "title": "Thankful for Facebook", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-10-thankful-for-facebook", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>A couple of days ago I searched Facebook for an Army buddy of mine that I haven’t seen in almost 10 years.

You think about the future because you know your code will live for years and you want it to handle coming changes with minimal maintenance. You think about the past because you have an existing code base that still needs to work correctly and users that rely upon your code. Even if your app is new with no existing code or users you still have to think about the devices that have come in the past that it will run on and you’ll have to support. Devices used by tiny percentages of the population can be owned by millions. Supporting the past quickly becomes overwhelming.</p><p>You always have to consider the future but you have a choice about the past. Your choice will depend upon your app and market. For example, if you are targeting the education sector then you need to keep in mind how old their devices and operating systems are. In general, push things forward and cut out old code and devices after 2-3 years.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-11-there-is-no-takeaway", "title": "There Is No Takeaway", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-11-there-is-no-takeaway", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>It feels right to say “the lesson from this is…” and make a pronouncement about how you are now wiser and won’t make that mistake again.

Even when I joined the Army, I went to the recruiter and said I wanted to sign up.</p><p>Sometimes my ego hurts a bit because of it, but in general I know I’m good at what I do so I don’t worry about it too much.

Probably.</p><p>I think another factor that weighs in this is that I haven’t been in one particular industry for more than five years and am rarely in any one position more than 18 months.

Once the excitement wears off a bit I get around to asking myself a very important question: why hasn’t this been done before?</p><p>I can think of four categories of answers this question could have:</p><ol><li><p><p>It has been done before but failed for some reason</p></p></li><li><p><p>It hasn’t been done before because no one cared enough to do it</p></p></li><li><p><p>It hasn’t been done before because it is/was technologically impossible</p></p></li><li><p><p>It hasn’t been done before because no one could make the financial numbers work</p></p></li></ol><p>Over the next several days I’m going to talk through these different possibilities and what they mean for your idea.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-19-emma-one-year-later", "title": "Emma, One Year Later", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-19-emma-one-year-later", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>A year ago, my daughter started <a href='http://brunow.org/2013/05/07/shes-seizing/' title='seizing in the back seat of my car'>seizing in the back seat of my car</a>.</p><p>Since that day she drinks a syrupy medicine twice a day and I carry a shot of Diazepam with me wherever we go. If she starts seizing again, I’ve been instructed to call 911 and watch the clock. If she seizes for five minutes then I inject the Diazepam in her rear.</p><p>Fortunately, she hasn’t started seizing again. From what I see, the seizure has had no adverse effect on her. Obviously, it is not possible to know what she would be like if she hadn’t had the seizure — but her curiosity and awareness of the world grows daily. She teaches me children’s songs and I teach her Beatles songs.</p><p>The past year hasn’t been about major breakthroughs — its about hundreds of incremental improvements. I am happy to say that Emma is really becoming herself. Now she is three and we can start to see her personality — hints of who she will be.</p><p>Emma started school a few months ago and has picked up some wonderful bad habits from the other kids. My favorite is when she doesn’t get her way and starts fake crying — the crying lasts for about five seconds and then she puts both hands on her nose, whinily saying “Nose”. I’ll have to get some video of it.</p><p>The part of that that really makes me happy is that she wants to get her way. That means something to me — that means that she knows what is going on around her.</p><p>I’ll share another thing she loves. I’m not a big fan of singing songs in the traditional manner every single time, that gets boring. So I’ll change the tempo of a song like “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” when I sing it with Emma – changing it from “Twin-kle Twin-kle, Lit-tle Star” to “Tweeeeeeeeeeenkle, Tweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeenkle, Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit-tle Staaaaaaaaar”. She absolutely adores it. Every time she sees me she grabs my mouth and starts singing it that way to me. She is also very quick to adapt. If I change the tempo in a different way then she will do the same.</p><p>These incremental improvements don’t lend themselves to my concept for <a href='http://EmmaCan.com' title='her site'>her site</a>. My intention there was always to show the major milestones and the big ways that she overcomes expectations. Because of that, I haven’t posted anything about her progress in a long time. I fear that may make anyone who has heard her story think she isn’t making progress or that she hasn’t recovered from her seizure.</p><p>So going forward, in addition to the major milestones, I will be doing “State of the Emma” posts there, to share all the little things that turn into something big when put together. I hope to have one out soon.</p><p>Thank you for caring about Emma.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-19-inside-the-frame", "title": "Inside the Frame", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-19-inside-the-frame", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’ve started getting into the basics of photography and shooting video and I’ve noticed something that is probably obvious to most people — in many cases what you see in the frame only shows a fraction of the work being put in to make something of quality.</p><p>For an example, I was recently shooting some pictures for a website we are working on. I’d found a picture that had a “feel” that I liked but the cost to license it was beyond our budget. So I staged a similar scene with two qualities in mind, brightness and calm. I think the pictures turned out great, and because viewers can only see what is in the frame, they won’t ever know that I was standing on a metal folding chair over a massage table in the corner of our office crammed less than a foot away from my desk next to a window with the morning sun coming through. They will see brightness and calm.</p><p>The same is true for shooting videos with quality audio — the microphone must be within a foot to a foot and a half from the speaker’s mouth but no one wants unsightly microphones in the video shot. So you either put it on a stand or have someone to hold it outside of the camera frame. Until recently I didn’t think about all this effort that went into getting good quality sound in a shot.</p><p>This applies to how you see others’ lives also. <a href='https://vimeo.com/78591456' title='Like others have said better than I can'>Like others have said better than I can</a>, you usually only see other peoples’ highlight reel and their finished products. Their hard work and trying times are outside the frame and it is so easy to forget about them. In some cases people do this intentionally — they build up a different view of themselves for the world and most of the world doesn’t dig deeply enough to see the truth. But in most cases it is just not feasible to show all the hard work and tough decisions — can you imagine a realistic rendition of the training from Rocky? You’d be watching a man wake up at the crack of dawn and run and lift weights and train hundreds of times in a row. I’d appreciate the realism but there is no way I’d sit through that.</p><p>So after all this rambling, what am I trying to say?</p><p>First, if you put up a façade of who you are then you will probably fool most people because they don’t dig deeply. Unfortunately, the ones that do dig deeply are generally the ones who care and will be disappointed in your inauthentic story.</p><p>Second, for everything you see that you like in this world, remember the massive amount of work that went into creating it. And remember that you will need to put in a similar amount of thankless work to create your great thing.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-19-it-has-been-done-before-but-it-failed", "title": "It Has Been Done Before But It Failed", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-19-it-has-been-done-before-but-it-failed", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Today I’ll continue the discussion I started yesterday about that moment after I’ve had an idea that I think is great. In that moment I ask myself “Why hasn’t this been done before?” One answer to that question is “Actually, it has been done before but it failed” so I’ll discuss how I handle that possibility. I think it’s important that I note here that I’m asking this question to determine whether I can turn my idea into a sustainable project and business. If you only care about making something you are fired up about then this question won’t matter to you.</p><p>The keys to handling this situation are research and finding root causes. I need to learn as much as possible about the previous attempts to do this thing. From that research I need to put together the facts to figure out why it failed. Most businesses fail because they run out of money but that isn’t helpful information here. I need to know <em>why</em> they ran out of money. I’ll also be tempted to blame the incompetence of the people who were trying to do this the first time. I’ll tell myself that I won’t be so dumb and make the mistakes they did. But again, that isn’t the root cause and, as a side note, I will make incompetent mistakes too although they may be different ones.</p><p>Ultimately the root cause should fall into one of two broad categories — the previous effort either went in unprepared, with too little cash or experience or talent or all three, or their target market didn’t care about their thing as much as they anticipated. After finding one of those root causes I have to ask myself “can I bring somethings to this that will avoid that problem?” Hopefully the answer is yes. Then that is the beginning of the slog to actually follow through and prove it.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-19-thoughts-on-consciousness", "title": "Thoughts on Consciousness", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-19-thoughts-on-consciousness", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>A huge cloud of consciousness floats over the land, loosely connected but all the same.</p><p>Drops fall from it and land on the ground just long enough to claim their individuality before returning to the nearest stream and joining their brothers and sisters, moving forward together and usually unaware of their bonds.

It is much more difficult to care about something over a long period. Words fail to express even the mundane parts of the day to day, serving as a poor form of communication.

I’ll identify a problem I have that I can solve fairly simply. For example, my Dharma Talks app that u created because listen to Mission Dharma’s Dharma Talks was difficult in a mobile web browser because it wouldn’t keep track of where I was in the talk between my morning and evening commutes. It is a simple app but no one cared enough to make it.</p><p>Another way of phrases that statement is that no one had a sufficient incentive to build that app. Which brings us to the fundamental problem when you are in this situation — you probably can’t make money off of your idea. I knew that going into making the Dharma Talks app because I volunteered to build it for a non-profit. But I’ve had other projects where I hadn’t realized the truth of this situation and put in time and energy with no direct monetary payback. I’m OK with that sometimes, but you may not be.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-21-unintended-benefit-of-doing-the-right-thing", "title": "Unintended Benefit of Doing the Right Thing", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-21-unintended-benefit-of-doing-the-right-thing", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I don’t break the speed limit, I don’t cross a busy street without a walk signal, I follow the rules when I ride my bike, and I have complex work around the house done by professionals.

If it can’t then the idea’s done, at least for now.

It is risky because you need to invest resources without any sure indication that you’ll have a market for what you’ve built at the end. It might be that people just don’t care about what you’ve made or it might be that someone beats you to market and takes the customers that you would have had.</p><p>It is fun because you get to do something that no one else has ever done. That’s the sort of possibility I need to find time to do.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-22-because-no-one-could-make-the-financial-numbers-work", "title": "Because No One Could Make The Financial Numbers Work", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-22-because-no-one-could-make-the-financial-numbers-work", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’m continuing my series of posts about that moment right after I’ve had what I think is a great idea. In that moment I ask myself “Why hasn’t this been done before?” One possible answer to that question is “Because no one could make the financial numbers work” which I’ll talk through now.</p><p>If I others haven’t been able to make the numbers work then you need to figure out if you can. Can you build it more efficiently so that you need a smaller total payback? Can you get your parts at enough of a discount to make it work? Can you remove the payment transactional fees? Have the cost of primary resources changed significantly since the last person tried? Or are you OK not making a living off of this thing or believe you’ll get enough non-monetary value out of it to make it worthwhile. Maybe it will help you form a relationship or spread the word about what you do. One word of caution from my experience — it is tough to rationalize working on things that don’t bring in money when you’re short on time. Your good intentions will be fighting against your psyche.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-22-before-or-after", "title": "Before Or After", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-22-before-or-after", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Yesterday I read a blog post about <a href='https://m.signalvnoise.com/warren-buffet-on-scheduling-meetings-f0826c0e88f6#.8jnx5easq' title='Warren Buffet’s rumored method for scheduling appointments'>Warren Buffet’s rumored method for scheduling appointments</a>.

First, because it really does matter that he is Warren Buffet. When you are a billionaire you have much more flexibility over your schedule. I work in consulting and can’t imagine telling my clients that they need to call me the day before a meeting to schedule it. Because I’m not Warren Buffet I’m not in the position to dictate terms to others.</p><p>The other reason it got under my skin is that it implicitly states “if you want to be successful like Warren Buffet then you should do this.” But we don’t know if this is a key component of his success.

I’ve gotten my hopes up about this amazing thing that I could do just to find out that someone else has beaten me to it. That part makes sense though — there are millions of apps out there solving hundreds of thousands of problems so it isn’t strange that my idea isn’t unique. But what do I do with it now?</p><p>Most likely nothing. You probably won’t add a lot of value by adding your take on a solution. You may look around and notice that all the other solutions aren’t very good and think you can do better and you probably can. But the problem is that the reason all the other solutions aren’t good is probably that there is little to no money in this area. No money means no motivation to improve your app which means crappy apps.</p><p>Can you add something that will give you different results? Or are you so fired up about this idea that you can’t not do it? Then by all means go for it!

I’ve written a tool that parses Conventional Commits and I’ll talk through how I use it to automate my releases.</p><h2 id='About-Conventional-Commits'>About Conventional Commits</h2><p>Conventional commits are a style of commit that originated in the Angular development team and are meant to solve the problem of automating versioning. I came across the idea of conventional commits years ago, before the standard linked above was created, when looking to automate module releases at a previous job.</p><p>Conventional commits are git commits which follow a specific format, for example:</p><div data-syntax=\"\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">feat: Add endpoint to the InputField API for formatting</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The <code>feat:</code> prefix in this format indicates that the change is a feature, which means that the semantic version’s minor version should be increased by one, and the description for that feature is “Add endpoint to the InputField API for formatting”.</p><h2 id='Implementing-Conventional-Commit-Parsing'>Implementing Conventional Commit Parsing</h2><p>To implement this parsing, we need two things:</p><ol><li><p><p>An automation workflow that uses the parsed values to inform versioning, and</p></p></li><li><p><p>Ergonomic interaction points to inform the person using these formatted commits about what the automation does</p></p></li></ol><p>I’ve written a command line tool, <a href='https://github.com/DavidBrunow/swift-conventional-commit-parser' title='Swift Conventional Commit Parser'>Swift Conventional Commit Parser</a>, which is integral to the workflow I use for release automation.<a href='../../documentation/brunow/05-27-automating-release-versioning.html'>Footnotes</a></p><p>Swift Conventional Commit Parser has two commands, one for running on a pull request and one for running on a branch which should create releases. The two commands behave almost exactly the same, so once you’ve learned one there isn’t much to learn about the other.</p><p>These commands were designed for the place we need them in our automation, so let’s talk about how the pull request and release automation works. Throughout the remainder of this, I’m going to call the Swift Conventional Commit Parser the “commit parsing tool” or “the tool” for the sake of brevity.</p><h3 id='Pull-Request-Automation'>Pull Request Automation</h3><p>I choose to use the commit parsing tool in the part of my pull request automation that runs tests. I do that because I use Danger Swift in that automation to report test results back to the pull request and it is simple to add the extra information from the commit parsing tool.

The <code>|| true</code> at the end ensures that this command does not exit in an error. This is needed to ensure the pipeline continues running and allows Danger Swift to report everything, including any errors, back to the pull request.</p><p>The only error the tool will emit is when there are no formatted commits on the pull request branch. This error message is a great place to help folks learn about Conventional Commits and can be customized using the optional <code>-n</code> argument to pass in your own error message, which could link to how you use Conventional Commits in your CI system. By default, the error message links to the README on the Swift Conventional Commit Parser repo, which talks about how I use Conventional Commits.</p><p>The standard output from the tool is JSON.

Before doing so, ensure you consider that anyone with write access to the repository would theoretically be able to modify a GitHub Action workflow to push changes to those protected branches. This works fine for me because I am not giving write access to anyone else – your approach will vary based upon your needs.</p></p></aside><p>This automation first installs <a href='https://jqlang.github.io/jq/' title='jq'>jq</a> because we’ll be doing all our JSON parsing of the tool’s output in the automation’s shell script. If the <code>bumpType</code> is equal to “none”, and therefore no release is needed, the automation exits early. Otherwise, the release notes are added to the changelog, the code’s version is updated, the changes are added and committed to git, the repo is tagged, and all the changes are pushed to origin. The details about how this automation works is specific to the way I have my codebases setup, but the general process would be the same for any codebase.</p><p>With this automation in place, every commit to a release branch creates a new, properly semantically versioned release that can be distributed to your users.</p><p>That’s all it takes to setup this automated semantic versioning. Next I’ll talk about some approaches for this kind of automation that I rejected, in case you’re interested.</p><h2 id='Rejected-Alternative-Approaches'>Rejected Alternative Approaches</h2><p>When figuring out how to automate versioning a few years ago, I considered and rejected a couple of approaches. I think it is useful to talk through why I rejected them, because at first glance they seem like a simpler approach than what I follow today. Plus, talking through them reveals what is important about the problem space of automating versioning. I’ll also talk through another approach that I did not consider a few years ago but that I think is relevant to the thought process:</p><ul><li><p><p>Always bumping the patch version for any non-breaking changes</p></p></li><li><p><p>Using specially formatted branch names</p></p></li><li><p><p>Using specially formatted pull request titles</p></p></li></ul><h3 id='Rejected-approach-Always-bumping-the-patch-version-for-any-non-breaking-changes'>Rejected approach: Always bumping the patch version for any non-breaking changes</h3><p>This is an approach that I didn’t consider when I first starting thinking about automating versioning, but I’ve recently heard that other folks might be doing this for their build automation. I’d reject this approach for a few reasons:</p><ol><li><p><p>Always bumping the patch version means that you aren’t actually following semantic versioning, and I believe the most value you get out of semantic versioning is in the “semantic” part of it. Always bumping the patch version loses the semantic meaning of a version, which brings me to my second reason.</p></p></li><li><p><p>As a client of a library that bumps versions like this, I cannot trust the versioning to provide me with any information about how easy it will be to adopt the changes.</p></p></li><li><p><p>If you always bump the patch version, there is no “room” between versions to make a hotfix. For example, if I need to make a hotfix for version 1.0.1 but versions 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4, and 1.0.5 have already been created, I have to get creative in my version naming to create a version between 1.0.1 and 1.0.2. If I were OK with the first point above, I’d bump the minor version by default to avoid this issue – but I’m definitely not OK with the first point.</p></p></li></ol><h3 id='Rejected-approach-Using-specially-formatted-branch-names'>Rejected approach: Using specially formatted branch names</h3><p>I considered using specially formatted branch names, but that approach meant you either needed to know what kind of change you would be making when you started your effort, or you would have to change your branch name later in the effort to match the type of change. And while I like small efforts, one change per branch seemed overly limiting. Plus, in git, branches are ephemeral. I believe that any automated versioning should be idempotent and stable over time – no matter how many times it is run, given the same inputs it should always produce the same versions – and that would not be true when using branch names due to their inherent instability. Therefore I believe we should base our versioning on things that git considers to be more stable.</p><h3 id='Rejected-approach-Using-specially-formatted-pull-request-titles'>Rejected approach: Using specially formatted pull request titles</h3><p>After rejecting specially formatted branch names, I considered something more flexible – pull request titles. Since pull request titles can be changed at any point in the pull request process, one could change the format of it without disrupting the remainder of the workflow too much since you don’t need to create a new pull request. But this approach has many of the same limitations as using branch names around one change per pull request and the automated versioning not being idempotent and stable over time.</p><p>Even worse, this approach would couple your automated versioning to your source control platform (GitHub, GitLab, etc.), which would be overly limiting in the long term.</p><h2 id='Footnotes'>Footnotes</h2><p><a href='../../documentation/brunow/05-27-automating-release-versioning.html'>Implementing Conventional Commit Parsing</a>: There are <a href='https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/about/#tooling-for-conventional-commits' title='many other tools out there that can parse conventional commits'>many other tools out there that can parse conventional commits</a>, many of those may fit your needs as well, but I know my tool better than those.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2024-05-27T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-27-confronting-reality", "title": "Confronting Reality", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-27-confronting-reality", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I have a strange balance of cynicism and idealism in the way I see the world. One area where I’ve been overly idealistic is when thinking about the power, influence, and voice that having large sums of money give you. In our democracy every person has a voice but the rich have a louder and more respected voice. I’ve tried to convince myself otherwise — that the poor and scrappy can get their voice heard too — but a few recent events have left me feeling jaded.</p><p>These events have one thing in common — the rich using the justice system and the ridiculous cost of going to court to get what they want. It is a crazy sort of vigilanteeism. One event is Peter Thiel’s war to destroy Gawker. Peter Thiel is a billionaire that was attacked by the online publication around 10 years ago and now he’s found a way to destroy them by financing lawsuits for third parties, like Hulk Hogan, against them. Another event is fictional but I’m sure it happens in reality also. It is the lawsuit that Hooli brings against Pied Piper on the TV show Silicon Valley. Hooli is the multi billion dollar giant corporation that can’t compete with the technology created by the poor start up Pied Piper on its own. It has to bring a frivolous lawsuit against them in order to stop them. The other example is private and I’m not going to share it here but I hope you get the idea from the first two.</p><p>I feel like justice in America is a luxury for the rich and I don’t like that. But I don’t know a better way to do it either.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/05-27-direction", "title": "Direction", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/05-27-direction", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>What would you think if I told you that neurons in your brain fire differently depending on which direction you are facing and that you could improve aspects of your life by facing certain directions as much as possible.

Most days we walk the same route and see the same things. He smells the same trees and hydrants and marks the same spots. We usually see the same dogs at the same houses and those dogs bark or yap at him walking by.</p><p>But some days he doesn’t get barked at. Maybe we go at a different time and none of the dogs are out. Or maybe they are locked in the house because it is too wet out. Whatever it is, it seems to throw Dozer off a bit. He stares at the yard that usually has barking dogs as we walk by and he seems tense and more alert. He seems to believe that something is wrong.</p><p>Here is one interpretation that makes sense to me. A forest becomes quiet when a large threat is lurking. No creature wants to give away its location when it is threatened. Perhaps he goes on high alert when he doesn’t hear those familiar barks because he is worried that he is in danger.</p><p>Or maybe that’s the wrong interpretation. Dozer is a big dog and maybe he gets insecure when he isn’t being barked at. Surely, a dog of his size and strength should be seen as a threat by every dog he passes. If he doesn’t get those barks then he isn’t getting the respect he deserves.</p><p>Obviously I have no idea what goes through Dozer’s mind, but these are things I think about. And this all leads me to a hypothesis that I’m working on that I still haven’t quite fleshed out.

One common topic of conversation is discoverability — how easy it is for customers to find my all. All of them seem to have the point of view that this problem of discoverability is unique to what we do. Some of them point to the faults in the App Store and say the Apple needs to fix this problem to help them.</p><p>Discoverability is a universal business problem and the best way that business has found to solve it so far is marketing. It isn’t Apple’s problem to solve, it is yours. Just like it isn’t a shopping center’s responsibility to ensure that a donut shop has customers. You, the iOS app developer, have to put effort in to let customers know about the awesome thing you’re doing — just like every other business.</p><p>Is there room for improvement on the App Store? Always.

The site will allow developers to submit their code, which they believe is buggy due to the frameworks, for peer review. Since I have a large influence in the iOS Development Community, I can convince the best of the best developers to have a look at the code.</p><p>This peer review process will solve problems. First, it will get rid of many bad bug reports being filed to Apple, because someone would point out the error in the developer’s code that isn’t in the framework. Second, it would strengthen the reputation of pre-radar.com in the eyes of the community and in the eyes of Apple. Apple would be able to trust reports filed from the community. Third, it would build a combined voice that single tweets and angry blog posts cannot match — here are the bugs that we have found and verified: fix them.</p><p>By doing this, I also solve another big complaint about the current system – lack of transparency. The entire community can see everything submitted, and other developers can vote “me too” about bugs, after submitting their own code that shows the same behaviour.</p><p>I know, I know — Apple should do this. It is their responsibility to fix their system. But I’m a part of that system.

When the Emperor parades before his subjects in his new clothes, no one dares to say that he doesn’t see any suit of clothes until a child cries out, “But he isn’t wearing anything at all!”</p></p></p></aside><p>It isn’t that I don’t understand the story but that I don’t know how to apply that lesson in the real world.

Fewer times I’ve met people that think they are filling the child’s role who simply come across as assholes when they speak up.</p><p>Many things that I see as stupid make me want to  say something.

Few situations in your life will be as clear cut as a naked Emperor.</p><p>Here is how I suggest to handle it. In the great minority of situations you must say something, but you will know those times. Things like standing up for human rights.</p><p>The rest of the time, you don’t say anything at all.

I didn’t even know what would make me outstanding — I didn’t have that concept in my head. I could shoot from the outside really well but I couldn’t dribble the ball great so it was easy for little guys to take it from me and I’d get out of breath easily (although that was a problem our entire team had).</p><p>If I could go back and coach myself I’d make myself do the things I didn’t like more of the time. I’d have made myself run every day and constantly practice dribbling. Only then would I let myself practice the fun part of shooting.</p><p>I’d teach myself that I can improve in areas that I don’t like by just sticking with them every day. I’d build the confidence that I could out run, out shoot, and out dribble anyone.

Take hiring a new employee as an example. The likelihood of finding the right person is a function of how clear the requirements for the position are and how much you know about each candidate. In most hiring situations I’ve been around the job is poorly defined and the only information you have about the candidate is what they have told you through their resume, cover letter, and a series of interviews. This is a situation where both parties need much more data to make a good decision. The amount of data is far beyond what you can get from doubling the number of interviews. You need to know what it is like to work with that person every day. She needs to know what her real job is and what her coworkers will be like to work with every day. Thousands if not hundreds of thousands of additional data points are needed. But they have to be the right data points. We don’t need to take her on a corporate retreat to see how she’d fit in (unless frequent corporate retreats are part of the job). We need relevant data. All the data in the world would actually make things harder to use because we can’t easily know which parts are relevant. The data we need is specific to our applicant, our people, our company, and the position we need.</p><p>This job applicant example was an easy one for me to come up with but I’m sure it isn’t the only situation where the same factors apply. How can you apply the same idea to your problems that don’t have great solutions?</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/06-05-data-as-a-replacement-for-understanding-human-psychology", "title": "Data As A Replacement For Understanding Human Psychology", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/06-05-data-as-a-replacement-for-understanding-human-psychology", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Let’s take an example of collecting data on how your customers use your website. You can see what they click on, how often they visit, what kind of device they are on, and many other things that can tell you about them. You can use this data to make some relevant decisions like what kinds of devices you need to focus your testing on or what languages you need to support. Using the data in this way is smart and a powerful use of analytics.</p><p>I have a bias against using analytics because of another way people use them — to try to predict behavior. This is purely conjecture, but I feel like companies collecting huge amounts of data do so because they don’t understand human psychology and they believe that data about human behavior is a good replacement for that understanding. They probably think that the data is better than psychology because it is hard and factual compared to the inherent squishiness of psychology since humans are squishy.</p><p>Part of the reason I’m biased against analytics is because I believe I’m good at understanding human psychology. That shapes the way we run our company and is probably one of the fundamental reasons that companies like Apple and Google have such different approaches to product development. Apple believes they know what people want and only show the world those things. Google believes that data will tell them what people want and shares everything they are working on so they can get more data. I’m not sure that either approach is wrong but the approach you choose must be aligned with your resources and culture, so there may be a right and wrong answer for your situation.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/06-05-the-david-brunow-podcast-episode-9", "title": "The David Brunow Podcast Episode 9 — Learning from Smart People", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/06-05-the-david-brunow-podcast-episode-9", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Howdy!</p><p>On the ninth episode of The David Brunow Podcast I talked about the projects I’m currently working on, my thoughts on AI and big data, listening to and learning from very smart people, and how my previous efforts at doing this podcast have failed and how I’m trying to adapt to avoid that going forward.</p><h3 id='Links'>Links</h3><p>Jeff Bezos at Code Conf: <a href='https://www.facebook.com/RecodeDotNet/videos/1048414361915213/' title='https://www.facebook.com/RecodeDotNet/videos/1048414361915213/'>https://www.facebook.com/RecodeDotNet/videos/1048414361915213/</a></p><p>Elon Musk at Code Conf: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsixsRI-Sz4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLKof9YSAshgyPqlK-UUYrHfIQaOzFPSL4' title='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsixsRI-Sz4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLKof9YSAshgyPqlK-UUYrHfIQaOzFPSL4'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsixsRI-Sz4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLKof9YSAshgyPqlK-UUYrHfIQaOzFPSL4</a></p><p>The Critical Path Podcast: <a href='http://5by5.tv/criticalpath' title='http://5by5.tv/criticalpath'>http://5by5.tv/criticalpath</a></p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/06-05-the-value-of-repetition", "title": "The Value of Repetition", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/06-05-the-value-of-repetition", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I have a pretty good memory and get bored fairly easily.

The idea is small and I’ve spent a disproportionate amount of time thinking about it.</p><p>I know that diversity of ideas and opinions in a work team is a good thing. <a href='http://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/better_decisions_through_diversity' title='Research shows this.'>Research shows this.</a> Despite this knowledge, I was getting very frustrated by some of the ideas of my team members that conflicted with my own. I didn’t understand how a good thing could be affecting me that way. My rational mind was telling me “It is good to have this kind of diversity, it balances out the team. Your strength in this area will balance out a similar weakness in others.”</p><p>I’ve had a number of lengthy conversations with friends about this topic and I kept coming back to the idea that some diversity of ideas is good and some is bad[^1]. I just couldn’t figure out the distinction between the bad and good.</p><p>Recently I’ve figured it out: Values. My definition of Values is ideas that mean something important to a person.</p><p>If I split my ideas and opinions into two categories, Values and Everything Else, then my internal conflict makes sense. I can give myself a pass for not giving in on my Values[^2]. I’ll give some examples.</p><p>First, an idea that isn’t a Value, at least for me. “High Fructose Corn Syrup is an awful invention that is making our world more unhealthy.” I fully believe that idea, but I won’t feel frustrated if someone I know drinks a Coke. Here’s another, “The Mac OS is far more stable and powerful than the Windows OS.” I definitely agree with this, but I don’t grind my teeth every time I walk by someone running Windows 8.</p><p>Now, an idea that is a strong Value for me. “The point of making things is to help other people, not to make money.” This idea resonates with me. Working in an environment with an atmosphere filled with views to the contrary leads to frustration. I am not a good fit for that environment.</p><p>So what are my Values? I don’t know them all, but here are a handful:</p><ul><li><p><p>The point of making things is to help other people, not to make money</p></p></li><li><p><p>The best way to get more work is to deliver high quality work</p></p></li><li><p><p>Spend as much as you can on high quality tools</p></p></li><li><p><p>Be happy to pay for things</p></p></li><li><p><p>Ideas alone are worthless</p></p></li><li><p><p>The right technique or strategy does not deliver high quality work — doing the hard work does</p></p></li><li><p><p>Every being in this world is connected, and everything you do changes another’s life either for better or worse</p></p></li><li><p><p>You cannot compartmentalize your life or your mind</p></p></li><li><p><p>What you repeatedly do you will repeatedly do</p></p></li><li><p><p>You cannot multitask and the one thing you are doing right now deserves your full attention</p></p></li><li><p><p>Software should be designed for the user, not for the programmer</p></p></li></ul><p>[^1]: My statement that “some diversity is good and some is bad” is highly context-dependent. I am definitely not saying that no one in this world should have different Values than I do. I am saying that a difference of Values between the people you see every day causes problems.</p><p>[^2]: Not giving in on Values still does not make it OK to be a bigot.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/06-07-corporate-and-football-penalties", "title": "Corporate and Football Penalties", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/06-07-corporate-and-football-penalties", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>What if the penalties in football were more like the penalties in the corporate world?

This makes perfect sense for its intended purpose, but I’m not sure how I feel about it for this purpose I’m misusing it for.</p></p></li><li><p><p>The site that DocC generates has a base path of “documentation/MODULE_NAME” but I’d rather the site were at the root with no extra path. But really, do people care what URL they are linked to for a blog post? I don’t.</p></p></li><li><p><p>I don’t believe that DocC generates an RSS feed which is my favorite way of consuming a blog.</p></p></li></ul></p></p></aside><p>After using it for a year, I think I like the style of my blog that looks like documentation. And like a year ago, I don’t really care about the URL structure of my blog. I could not remember the URL for my blog, so I created a redirect from brunow.org to the blog so that’s all I needed to remember – the rest is fine by me.</p><p>But the third bullet has been bothering me, so I decided to do something about it – I’ve strung together a handful of tools to create a JSON feed every time I rebuild my site. I’ll talk through how I did that.</p><h2 id='Hacking-Together-a-JSON-Feed'>Hacking Together a JSON Feed</h2><p>Building a DocC site from the command line requires running a command similar to this:</p><div data-syntax=\"sh\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">swift package --allow-writing-to-directory docs \\</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"2\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  generate-documentation --target Brunow --disable-indexing \\</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"3\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  --output-path docs --transform-for-static-hosting \\</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"4\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  --hosting-base-path brunow.org</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>That’s quite a bit to type, so from the beginning I’ve used a super simple script called <code>build-site.sh</code> to run this command:</p><div data-syntax=\"sh\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">#! /bin/sh</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"2\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\"></span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"3\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">swift package --allow-writing-to-directory docs \\</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"4\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  generate-documentation --target Brunow --disable-indexing \\</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"5\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  --output-path docs --transform-for-static-hosting \\</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"6\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  --hosting-base-path brunow.org</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>This script is the perfect place to add logic to build my feed.</p><p>JSON feeds have <a href='https://www.jsonfeed.org/version/1.1/' title='a detailed specification'>a detailed specification</a>, which, in my opinion, makes this problem more fun to solve. I find something satisfying about having a well-defined problem space and implementing it to the specification. The icing on top of that satisfaction is the fact that I have a specific purpose, so I don’t need to build a general purpose thing (which is much more difficult). I get to focus on my use case and making it work well.</p><p>In the JSON feed specification I see two different types of data: static and dynamic. The static data will be the same every time my feed is generated, and that data can be hardcoded. It could look like this, easy peasy:</p><div data-syntax=\"sh\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">items=()</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"2\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\"></span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"3\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">PREVIOUS_IFS=IFS</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"4\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">IFS=,</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"5\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">feed_json=&quot;{\\&quot;version\\&quot;: \\&quot;https://jsonfeed.org/version/1.1\\&quot;, \\&quot;title\\&quot;: \\&quot;Brunow\\&quot;, \\&quot;home_page_url\\&quot;: \\&quot;https://brunow.org/\\&quot;, \\&quot;feed_url\\&quot;: \\&quot;https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/feed.json\\&quot;, \\&quot;items\\&quot;: [${items[*]}]}&quot;</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"6\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">IFS=PREVIOUS_IFS</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"7\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\"></span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"8\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">printf &quot;%s&quot; &quot;$feed_json&quot; &gt; docs/documentation/brunow/feed.json</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>I find handwriting JSON simple and straightforward, so that’s what I’ve done. The static data is the version, title, home page URL, and feed URL. In anticipation of adding the dynamic data, I’ve created an array of items and I’ve added them to the static JSON – I’ll fill out that dynamic data in the items array in a bit. The <code>IFS</code> part will be used later – it will join the items in the items array with a comma. On the last line we print the JSON to a file. Before we add the dynamic data, let’s look at what our JSON will look like so far, formatted in a nicer way:</p><div data-syntax=\"json\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">{</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"2\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;https://jsonfeed.org/version/1.1&quot;,</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"3\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Brunow&quot;,</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"4\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">    &quot;home_page_url&quot;: &quot;https://brunow.org/&quot;,</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"5\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">    &quot;feed_url&quot;: &quot;https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/feed.json&quot;,</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"6\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">    &quot;items&quot;: []</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"7\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">}</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>OK, looks good, let’s move on to the dynamic content. We need to fill in that items array with posts. Looking at the JSON feed spec, we need data for these fields:</p><ul><li><p><p><code>content_html</code></p></p></li><li><p><p><code>date_published</code></p></p></li><li><p><p><code>id</code></p></p></li><li><p><p><code>summary</code></p></p></li><li><p><p><code>title</code></p></p></li><li><p><p><code>url</code></p></p></li></ul><p>Fortunately, DocC generates an entire folder of JSON files which describe the posts, and we can use values from that JSON to create our items. We’ll use <a href='https://jqlang.github.io/jq/' title='jq'><code>jq</code></a> to parse the JSON:</p><div data-syntax=\"sh\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">for file in docs/data/documentation/brunow/*.json</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"2\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">do</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"3\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  json=`cat &quot;$file&quot; | jq`</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"4\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  id=`printf &quot;%s&quot; &quot;$json&quot; | jq -r .identifier.url`</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"5\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  title=`printf &quot;%s&quot; &quot;$json&quot; | jq -r .metadata.title`</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"6\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  url=`printf &quot;%s&quot; &quot;$id&quot; | sed &#39;s#doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/#https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/#g&#39;`</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"7\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  summary=`printf &quot;%s&quot; &quot;$json&quot; | jq -r .abstract[]?.text | sed -e &#39;:a&#39; -e &#39;N&#39; -e &#39;$!ba&#39; -e &#39;s/\\n/ /g&#39;`</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"8\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  date_published=`printf &quot;%s&quot; &quot;$json&quot; | jq -r .metadata.platforms[0].introducedAt | tr . -`</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"9\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\"></span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"10\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  content_html=&quot;where can we get this!?!&quot;</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"11\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\"></span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"12\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  if [[ &quot;$date_published&quot; != &quot;null&quot; ]]</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"13\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  then</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"14\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">    items+=(&quot;{\\&quot;id\\&quot;:\\&quot;${id}\\&quot;, \\&quot;title\\&quot;: \\&quot;${title}\\&quot;, \\&quot;url\\&quot;: \\&quot;${url}\\&quot;, \\&quot;content_html\\&quot;: \\&quot;${content_html}\\&quot;, \\&quot;summary\\&quot;: \\&quot;${summary}\\&quot;, \\&quot;date_published\\&quot;: \\&quot;${date_published}T23:59:59-06:00\\&quot;}&quot;)</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"15\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  fi</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"16\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">done</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>We loop over each JSON file in the directory, extract the JSON into a variable with <code>jq</code>, then parse different values from the JSON variable using <code>jq</code>, <code>sed</code>, and <code>tr</code>.

Therefore, I simply need to grab that version and reformat it for the date format that JSON feeds expect. Then I’m good to go.</p><p><picture><source media='(prefers-color-scheme: light)' srcset='../../images/Brunow/dateBasedVersioning@2x.png 2x'><img alt='Screenshot of the top of one of my recent blog posts, showing that the “version” is “Brunow 2024.05.27+”, where 2024.05.27 represents the date that I published the post.' srcset='../../images/Brunow/dateBasedVersioning@2x.png 2x' src='../../images/Brunow/dateBasedVersioning@2x.png' /></source></picture></p><p>The <code>content_html</code> field is not as straightforward. Despite the fact that DocC builds documentation that can be hosted on a web server, it does not build HTML. Instead, it creates a single page application (SPA) that uses JavaScript to parse the documentation’s JSON for rendering. Fortunately, Helge Heß has an open source project, <a href='https://github.com/DoccZz/docc2html?tab=readme-ov-file' title='docc2html'><code>docc2html</code></a>, which takes the output of the DocC generation and parses it into HTML in a very similar directory structure. We can use that tool like so:</p><div data-syntax=\"sh\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">./docc2html docs htmldocs -f -t ../docc2html/Templates</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p><code>docs</code> is the output folder from DocC, and <code>htmldocs</code> is where I want <code>docc2html</code> to output the HTML. I use <code>-t</code> to point to the <code>docc2html/Templates</code> folder because I overrode the header in the templates and I want to use that instead of the default. After running this, we have a folder full of HTML files, each of which pairs up with a JSON file in our DocC output. And they are both named the same, aside from their extensions being different. That makes it easy to add this code to our shell script to set the <code>content_html</code>:</p><div data-syntax=\"diff\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">...</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"2\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">for file in docs/data/documentation/brunow/*.json</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"3\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">do</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"4\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  ...</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"5\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  date_published=`printf &quot;%s&quot; &quot;$json&quot; | jq -r .metadata.platforms[0].introducedAt | tr . -`</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"6\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\"></span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"7\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">+  filename=$(basename $file .json)</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"8\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">+  html_file=&quot;htmldocs/documentation/brunow/$filename.html&quot;</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"9\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">+  content_html=`cat &quot;${html_file}&quot; | sed &#39;s#\\\\\\\\#\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\#g&#39; | sed -e &#39;:a&#39; -e &#39;N&#39; -e &#39;$!ba&#39; -e &#39;s/\\n/\\\\\\n/g&#39; | sed &#39;s/[&quot;]/\\\\\\&quot;/g&#39;`</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"10\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\"></span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"11\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  if [[ &quot;$date_published&quot; != &quot;null&quot; ]]</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"12\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  ...</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"13\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">done</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"14\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">...</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>We get the filename without the extension from the JSON filename, then use that filename to set a variable with the contents of the HTML file, plus some escaping to ensure the HTML doesn’t break our JSON.</p><p>And that’s it!

Knowing this inspires me to put similar work into what I do and to persevere when getting it right seems insurmountable.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/06-14-cleaning-it-up-later", "title": "Cleaning It Up Later", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/06-14-cleaning-it-up-later", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I have a bad habit when I’m making something and I’m starting to get tired. I’ll encounter a more challenging or tedious problem then I can handle at the time and I tell myself “I’ll come back to this later” and add it to a mental checklist of things that need fixing later. This leads to an awful burden as I progress through a project and this list grows. It also leads to me thinking that I’m further along in the project than I am because I forget about these items while measuring my progress.</p><p>I figure there are three ways I can improve upon my methodology that will help me create better quality things, measure progress better, and reduce my mental overhead during a project:</p><ol><li><p><p>Push myself to solve the problem right when I notice myself falling into this tendency — Sometimes I have the mental energy to solve the problem and I’m just being a bit lazy. In those cases I need to push myself a little harder.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Keep a written list of the items that I need to revisit — This will reduce my mental overhead while also providing a better way of estimating progress since these items are written down right in front of me.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Take a break — Sometimes my mind is tapped out and I just need to stop and go for a walk or sit and enjoy some quiet. In those situations, pushing myself forward will lead to poorer output and wasted time.</p></p></li></ol><p>Now that I’ve outlined these solutions I’m going to set myself up for success by preparing my work environment in any ways I can to reduce friction while working. In this case, I’ll start a list on one of the windows in the office that I use as a draw erase board for each project I’m working on so I can quickly add items without thinking much effort. Plus I’ll dump out anything that’s been collecting in my brain already.</p><p>Once I’ve done that, I’ll only have one hard problem — figuring out which option is the right one for each situation.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/06-14-limitations-of-research", "title": "Limitations Of Research", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/06-14-limitations-of-research", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Researching what you want to do — the project you want to bring to the world — will only get you so far.

The language is undergoing big changes which will likely irritate many people. Every project that has been created in Swift will need to have at least one line of code changed and likely more. This is exactly the type of “bad thing” that people waiting to adopt Swift have been warnings about — the change that breaks everything and makes everything you already know useless.</p><p>The leaders and contributors on the Swift project, which is open source, had to know that they’d get significant pushback against a change this big that has the potential to break so many things. But in the name of getting the language right they pushed through. They have a higher standard that their pushing themselves toward and they knew they didn’t get there on the first iteration so they are making the necessary changes.</p><p>Almost all the code I’ve written over the last two years has been in Swift and each of the projects will need to be modified. I’m not irritated at this fact or the people who decided to change Swift. I love that they are raising the bar on quality and making something truly great. It inspires me to strive for the same.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/06-19-the-feeling-of-being-had", "title": "The Feeling of Being Had", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/06-19-the-feeling-of-being-had", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’m a very trusting person. I believe you don’t need a contract where a handshake will do and if something goes wrong I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt that it isn’t your fault.</p><p>But despite my trusting attitude, being in a situation where I feel like someone is taking advantage of me is awful. I can easily see why people inherently distrust — simply to avoid that feeling.</p><p>But inherent starts one of those vicious cycles. The situation you’re in worries you a little so you start thinking you can’t trust the person. The fear and other negative voices in your head start screaming at you that you’re doing something dumb and that you’re dumb for it and that you are a sucker. It’s a truly awful feeling that will take your feet out from under you. So you back out of the situation you’re in. You don’t have all the facts but backing out feels safer and smarter.</p><p>Then your mind goes to work to rationalize your decision. The stories you tell yourself and others change and you become the hero of them — the smart hero that saw what the evil person was doing to try to take advantage of your generosity. You repeat this story to yourself and to those you care about. The fear spreads and the cycle continues. The next time your friend is in a situation where she is feeling the same things she will remember your story and  the cycle continues, the fear spreading like a virus.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the real world you backed out of a situation that scared you but in which other the person intended no harm. She was just living her life and doing her thing and then something she did spooked you. She wasn’t out to get you. She didn’t want to steal from you or cause harm. She was just reacting to the changing events in her life. You will never know this, of course, and you will never know any benefits that might have come out of working through that situation.</p><p>I encourage you to sit with that awful feeling a little longer than you want to. Let it wash over you. Don’t react. Just sit, feel, and absorb. Let it pass. And once it passes, gather whatever information you need, and make a decision.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/06-20-hiding-the-truth", "title": "Hiding The Truth", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/06-20-hiding-the-truth", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>When I know my bank account is low I don’t like checking it.

If we owe sales tax or if we have shipping costs in addition to the price of our goods or services, we eat them. We do this because we don’t want our customers to be surprised by additional costs after they already had a cost in their mind.

I create a lot of software projects from scratch. As a consultant I get brought in to create a thing that hasn’t existed before and make it happen. Generally I go through this process shortly after the requirements have been outlined and before they’ve been fully defined. I’m good at handling situations with ambiguity which really helps when the client either doesn’t know or can’t express exactly what she wants.</p><p>During this process I try to keep everything as flexible as possible. This means quick iterations on items and not handling every special case during the first round. The first round of code is partially exploratory as we see what works and doesn’t once we hold it in our hand. This first round is one of a few rounds, each of which further hardens the code into something stable.</p><p>But in the early phases the code must remain malleable. For that reason I won’t handle every possible error condition or write tests in the early phases. That effort could be wasted in more than one way. First, we may decide that the feature isn’t necessary anyway and throw it out. Second, the more I build around the first phase of code the more invested in it I’ll feel and the less likely I am to remove something that isn’t working right. It isn’t rational, but I’ll feel like I’ve wasted the effort and remember how much I put into it and that will discourage me from taking actions I need to take.</p><p>I’ve never blacksmithed before, but I’m guessing the way I build an app is similar to how a blacksmith makes a sword — keeping it fluid and malleable in the early stages and making it harder and stronger with each subsequent pass.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/06-28-equality", "title": "Equality", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/06-28-equality", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Far too slowly our country is starting to put into effect the kinds of policies that represent the America that I was told that we were while growing up.

This dynamic rewards aggressive behavior and doing what you can to ensure that no one takes what is yours.</p><p>Out of state highway travel is all about you getting to a distant destination. Some others on the roads with you might be going to the same place, but the farther the distance the less likely that is. Most of the time you are surrounded by people that are going their own way to their own destination which is different than yours. They have no incentive to slow you down or cut you off because you achieving your goal has no effect on them achieving theirs.</p><p>You can choose which life you want. You can go after the same things that everyone else does and fight your way to the top (or be out-fought and remain somewhere in the middle.) Or you can decide your own path which doesn’t involve direct competition and allows you to peacefully make your way towards the place that is right for you.</p><p>I’m choosing the second.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/06-29-a-giant-castle-of-toothpicks", "title": "A Giant Castle of Toothpicks", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/06-29-a-giant-castle-of-toothpicks", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Some days software feels so fragile.

I stopped writing due to a number of factors but most of them are irrelevant for what I want to write about today. Today I’m going to focus on the technical reasons behind my writing drought, so the relevant bits are the ones around the technology that powered my blog: static site generation powered by a tool called <a href='https://github.com/donmelton/magneto' title='Magneto'>Magneto</a> and a Linux server hosted by Linode.</p><h2 id='Backstory'>Backstory</h2><p>Magneto is like many other static site generators in that it is written in Ruby, allows complete customization using Ruby templating and CSS, and parses a collection of Markdown files to generate the blog’s content. But Magneto is also different than the most popular static site generators in that the author built it as a fun side project and not for general use. I can’t remember with any certainty but I think they advised against anyone else using it. Apparently I’m drawn to using things I shouldn’t because I adopted it as my static site generator of choice shortly after they open sourced the project.</p><p>If you look in the archives here you can see that I wrote hundreds of posts using this setup. At times it was easy, especially when I was on a roll of posting regularly and my tooling (my computer, operating system, Ruby version, etc.) wasn’t changing. But when my posting was irregular or my tooling changed I felt pain. The errors I ran into were obtuse and cryptic. While trying to think of a way to describe it the only thing that comes to mind is <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QQdNbvSGok' title='the “PC LOAD LETTER” scene from the movie Office Space'>the “PC LOAD LETTER” scene from the movie Office Space</a>.</p><p>A large part of the problem is that I was learning Ruby as I encountered these issues and, while I was learning, Ruby was changing, growing, and releasing new versions. My pace of learning would never keep up with the pace of change because my use case was limited and I just didn’t flex those muscles often enough. My hobby use of Ruby could only lead to more pain.</p><p>After fighting with Ruby for who knows how long I still had the task of getting those files I generated onto the Linux server. It is a fairly straightforward task — all one needs to do is to run a tool called <code>rsync</code> from the Terminal to copy the files from one’s local machine, like the laptop I’m typing on right now, to the server. I cannot possibly explain, or even understand myself, all the tension in my body that has been built up by such a simple thing. I just could not remember how to run the command properly from one invocation to the next. This was fine when I could just press the up key in the Terminal to get to the last time I recited the encantation but that was not reliable enough over time because I’d lose the history in one way or another. Today I’d write a very simple shell script that would remember the command for me but at that time I had no experience with shell scripts. Back then my brain would much rather learn about new shiny tools than learn about the basic fundamentals like shell scripting.</p><p>Speaking of new shiny tools, somehow I got it into my head that a task runner was the thing I needed so I tried out the different task runners du jour, although the only two I can remember were a Rakefile and Grunt. Grunt is a tool written in JavaScript and everything I mentioned above about Ruby changing, growing, and releasing new versions is at least an order of magnitude worse (or better, depending on your point of view) in the JavaScript ecosystem. And I also had the same problem of not using these task runners enough to be familiar with their idiosyncrasies — neither Ruby nor that sector of the (very large) JavaScript ecosystem were part of my day-to-day work.</p><h2 id='Using-Tools-Im-Already-Using'>Using Tools I’m Already Using</h2><p>One theme from my experience has stood out more than any other:  not being intimately familiar with your tools and their ecosystem leads to the kind of pain that isn’t good for me. Given that, I’ve tried to find ways to use the same tools I use to develop for Apple’s platforms in my day job. That started with looking into some open source static site generators written in Swift but none of those stuck. The Swift those tools use is the same Swift that I use daily but the approach was much different than the code I would write and I wasn’t bought into the ecosystem for each of the projects. I also went a long ways down the path of writing my own static site generator but that has turned into a big thing that I haven’t been able to devote time to.</p><p>Something else clicked during WWDC this year. The improvements in DocC, Apple’s documentation generation tool which can also generate static sites, plus the support for documentation previews in Xcode made me think that maybe DocC could work for my blog. Plus, I write a lot of documentation as part of my job and I’ve wanted to get more familiar with DocC so I could use it even more at work. Seems like a win-win-win.</p><p>Well, everything isn’t perfect but so far I’m probably more pleased than displeased with my experience.</p><p>Here’s what I like about using DocC to generate my blog:</p><ul><li><p><p>Apple has created an opinionated and, to my eyes, pleasant design. My control over it is limited but not needing to make design decisions is nice and removes something that was causing me to get stuck.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Media handling is simple and straightforward.</p></p></li><li><p><p>I get automatic support for features I value, like light and dark mode switching, searching by post titles, and formatting of code blocks with proper syntax highlighting.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Everything is in an ecosystem (Swift Package Manager, DocC) that I can use ( and misuse) well due to my experience working with these tools daily.</p></p></li><li><p><p>I can easily build the site and push the changes to GitHub and host it on GitHub Pages for free.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Site generation is fast — it takes less than 2 seconds on my M2 MacBook Air.</p></p></li></ul><p>Here are some things that I find noteworthy but not good or bad:</p><ul><li><p><p>DocC will probably require a bit more manual work than other static site generators. For example, I don’t know of a way to loop over the <code>N</code> posts I’ve written most recently so I’m doing that manually. Other folks may have much less tolerance for that extra work but I actually kind of like it since the manual work is lightweight and doesn’t require abstractions.</p></p></li></ul><p>And here is what I don’t like about it:</p><ul><li><p><p>The site that DocC generates is very opinionated about looking like Apple’s documentation. This makes perfect sense for its intended purpose, but I’m not sure how I feel about it for this purpose I’m misusing it for.</p></p></li><li><p><p>The site that DocC generates has a base path of “documentation/MODULE_NAME” but I’d rather the site were at the root with no extra path. But really, do people care what URL they are linked to for a blog post? I don’t.</p></p></li><li><p><p>I don’t believe that DocC generates an RSS feed which is my favorite way of consuming a blog.</p></p></li></ul><aside class='note'><p class='label'>Note</p><p><p>I do want to be clear here to say that none of my complaints are about DocC itself and I wouldn’t ask for these things to change. The complaints are simply about how it fits into what I’m trying to do with my blog while holding the tool completely wrongly.</p></p></p></aside><h2 id='Workflow'>Workflow</h2><p>Here’s my workflow for writing posts using DocC now that I’ve finished the initial setup:</p><ol><li><p><p>Create a file with a “.draft” extension for a new post. Using this extension excludes the file from static site generation until I’m ready to publish it.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Write. I’m using Xcode 15 beta 2 for all my writing because it has a nice preview of the rendered document.</p></p></li><li><p><p>When ready to publish, change the file extension to “.md”.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Create a link to the new post on the home page, for example: <code>- &lt;doc:06-29-blog-as-documentation&gt;</code>.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Run a script that generates the site. The script runs this command which is quite a mouthful and difficult to memorize:</p></p></li></ol><div data-syntax=\"sh\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">swift package --allow-writing-to-directory docs generate-documentation --target Brunow --disable-indexing --output-path docs --transform-for-static-hosting</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<ol><li><p><p>Commit the docs directory.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Push the changes to GitHub. GitHub will automatically update the site.</p></p></li></ol><aside class='note'><p class='label'>Note</p><p><p>The workflow in step #5 is more complicated at the moment because I’ve created the Swift package for building the site in a separate directory, so I have to generate in one directory and then copy that directory over to the right place before committing. I didn’t include that in the steps because I expect it to be temporary but felt like I needed to add this note since I haven’t committed the package to the repo hosting the site.</p></p></p></aside><h2 id='Moving-Forward'>Moving Forward</h2><p>I’m definitely not sold on this solution but I’m giving it a go. I’ve converted all my old posts to a format that works with DocC and, although I still have some cleanup there, it should be enough content to give me a good feel of how the site looks and feels. I’m going to try living with it for a while and see what additional insights time will provide. Will I cringe when I look at it in a month? Or will I get burnt out on a workflow that is too heavy? Maybe I’ll be delighted each time I think about how I’m documenting myself. Only time will tell.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2023-06-29T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/06-29-relentless-innovation", "title": "Relentless Innovation", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/06-29-relentless-innovation", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’ve just started reading the book <a href='https://itun.es/us/UkoO2.l' title='“How to Fly a Horse”'>“How to Fly a Horse”</a> and although I’ve not gotten far what I have read has been mostly novel to me.

Jenni and I split the revenue from it and that works out to about a nice cup of coffee every three months. I attribute the slow sales to two factors:</p><ol><li><p><p>No marketing effort on my part</p></p></li><li><p><p>It isn’t a very good app</p></p></li></ol><p>I could solve #1 with some time and effort but I don’t think I can solve #2 which is the reason I’m writing this now. I’ve had a few bugs reported on the app and I need to decide whether they’re worth fixing or if I just need to let go of it. I really want this app to exist in the world but I think my stubbornness about it is causing more harm than good.</p><p>I’ve <a href='https://brunow.org/2013/05/01/minimal-to-a-fault/' title='written before about the app’s fundamental flaw'>written before about the app’s fundamental flaw</a> due to the restrictions in iOS that mean that I can’t build the functionality I want in the way that I want to. I want to be able to allow the user to setup alarms at their leisure and have those alarms play music from their chosen playlist without any additional effort on their part. But iOS doesn’t allow an app to start playing music whenever the app wants to — even if that app were instructed to do so by the phone’s owner. Therefore I’ve had to compromise the app by forcing the user to open it before she goes to bed and leaving it open all night.</p><p>This issue of forcing the app to be open all night isn’t the only crappy part of the experience and leads to other crappy side effects. Take for example the situation where the user gets a text after they’ve set their alarm. The alert won’t show up on the lock screen because the app is open. And if the user notices and decides to respond to the text then she also needs to remember to open the app again afterwards. Plus, since the phone is unlocked all night it has to be plugged in which isn’t very energy efficient. Plus plus, the phone being unlocked means that nightly backups might not get done. Plus plus plus, leaving the phone unlocked is a security risk because you are unconscious while anyone with access to your bedroom can get to all your private data on your phone.</p><p>As I said before I really want this app to exist in the world and despite these flaws I still want to use it every night. But I’m the guy who made it and I know every one of its flaws and how to work around each of them. Part of me is saying to myself “if I could only educate the users somehow!” I could add informational videos to the website and messages in the app about how to make it work optimally. I could add notifications to the user when they haven’t re-set the alarm properly after replying to a text or other notification. But the app would still be flawed. No matter how stubborn I am about it the app won’t be what I want it to be. It won’t be built to my quality standards and I feel like it reflects poorly upon me.</p><p>So I’m probably going to pull the app from the App Store soon but I wanted to post this and give anyone who care an opportunity to say “no, don’t do that!” Or “actually David you can get around your fundamental problem by doing ______” or “it is about time I can’t believe you thought it was a good idea in the first place.”</p><p>Do you have any thoughts?

Now I don’t mean that I try every conceivable combination to see what works, but I also don’t go to the effort to create a full logical proof before implementing a solution.</p><p>I think that sweet spot is the key to this technique working. You have to understand enough of the mechanics of the problem to be able to try a solution that is at least close to the right one. If you don’t understand those mechanics then the solution will be too far away to provide you any clues on how to get closer. You’ll be stuck far away from the solution. But at the same time, those trials could teach you more about the mechanics and move you closer to the solution.</p><p>If you work through the full logical proof then you are spending a lot of time on things that the human mind isn’t very good at and that computers are very good at. Things like looping and iterating — after all, if it was a problem with a solution that is simple for the human mind to understand then you would have just solved the problem without any trial and error.</p><p>So here’s my advice about solving problems: learn as much as you can about the problem, then try something to see if it works and repeat.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/07-07-getting-lost-in-the-process", "title": "Getting Lost In The Process", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/07-07-getting-lost-in-the-process", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I have a problem when I create things that you might have to.

These emotions steer her through life and take over in the appropriate circumstances. All the while she is creating memories which are depicted as marbles which contain a short video of the memory and are tinted by the emotion that was in control at the time. Every once in a while a special kind of memory rolls in, called a core memory. These core memories power the fundamental structures of who she is as a person — her passions and the things she cares about most deeply.</p><p>The part I’m trying to relate to my life is this concept of core memories.

And those things on the shelves made me wonder about the value of knowing what’s on the shelves.</p><p>What information can I get from the things they have in stock, where they are located in the store, and how many they have on the shelves? Is that information useful in anyway or could it only lead to false conclusions? Is it useful data or just more clutter?</p><p>The store had several shelves for toy cars, small versions of real cars rather than imaginary cars. Amongst those toy cars was a high percentage of Aston Martins — I didn’t count but probably 20-30% of them were Astons. I find this strange because Astons are a particularly fast car or good car in terms of high performance cars. And I didn’t see any of what I would call good high performance cars there like Porsches or Ferraris. So why were there so many Astons? I can’t tell without more information. It could be that they sell a lot of the Astons at that store. Or maybe they sell a lot of them on average over all the stores. Or maybe the creator of the Aston toys pays more money for shelf placement and so they bought that ratio. Or maybe I saw so many because Astons don’t sell as well as the others.</p><p>Obviously I don’t have enough information to change what I perceived from mere information to real data. But that doesn’t mean the information itself isn’t useful because our brains are built to find connections. Each new thing we learn get organized with everything else we know and tested for logical accuracy. So each new piece of information can possibly spur something we can’t imagine now.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/07-13-accepting-reality", "title": "Accepting Reality", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/07-13-accepting-reality", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Much of my dissatisfaction in life comes from unreasonable expectations which should be fairly easy to solve by just altering my expectations.

I have a few of these situations in mind and might write about the topic more in the future, but right now I want to talk about free software.</p><p>Software is very expensive to create. The average software developer made $92,660 a year in 2013 according to <a href='http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/software-developer/salary' title='US News'>US News</a>. And the companies that are giving away free software have 10s, 100s, or even 1,000s of software developers.</p><p>So how can software be free?</p><p>I believe there are two reasons: 1) companies profit from free software by selling their users’ data and 2) money is very cheap to come by for people that have money so even investments on the sillier side are finding cash.</p><p>I think both of these are temporary and that at some point our reality must correct itself. At that point, I think we’ll see less free software. We may also see a lot more software developers looking for work as the cheap money dries up.</p><p>Having formed these assumptions, I’m giving myself a thought exercise. I think about how these changes would affect me and how I can plan for and benefit from them. It is a fun exercise and coaxes me to think in ways that I don’t in the rest of my work.</p><p>So what doesn’t make sense in your world?

The initial concept for the site was a sort of picture based storybook, something that I could read to my daughter as a bedtime story perhaps. None of the templates on Squarespace did exactly what I wanted, so I got a close approximation of what I wanted by futzing around with javascript and CSS every time that I made a post.</p><p>All of that futzing meant that I only made about 3 posts, all very soon after I created the site. I attribute that lack of posting to two factors (and I like to believe that it isn’t because I’m a bad father):</p><ol><li><p><p>The time it took to make a post — to make the Squarespace site do what I wanted it to do, I had to spend about 20 to 30 minutes for each post. That was mostly because I would have to look at the past posts to re-learn what I had hacked together the previous time.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Having to log in to Squarespace — I’ve found that having to log in to a service is a large enough hurdle to discourage me from using it. Any friction in the form of discouragement is a factor that will undermine my intentions and that I want to eliminate.</p></p></li></ol><p>So I decided to abandon Squarespace and create another Magneto site.</p><h2 id='Change-of-Plans'>Change of Plans</h2><p>As I said earlier, I had an idea in my head of creating a website that was sort of like a children’s bedtime story book, to which I would add new information about my daughter as she grew up and could do more things. But I ran into problems with this concept. Where would a new user start in reading the story? If I put them at the beginning of the book then they would get the full effect of the story. However, my friends and family that checked back often would have to jump through hurdles to get to the new stuff. Additionally, in a children’s book there is generally one picture and caption per page. Having the same effect on the web would require a lot of clicking and waiting[^1], delivering a poor overall user experience.</p><p>So I abandoned the original idea and one of my primary reasons for leaving Squarespace[^2]. The new concept reminds me of what you would see on many Tumblr sites, pictures or videos with some comments.</p><h2 id='New-Implementation'>New Implementation</h2><p>Setting up Magneto was very easy to do. I simply followed <a href='http://brunow.org/2013/03/27/magneto/' title='my instructions'>my instructions</a> (having to fix a couple of typos along the way) and I had the basic site up in a few minutes. It is so much easier the second time around.</p><p>Despite changing my overall concept of the site, I still want to tell a story through the use of pictures and videos. In order to do that, I had to make some modifications to the stock Magneto setup.</p><p>First, I added some hacky javascript to the article template so that my pictures are in a separate div from the caption text. You can see that javascript in <a href='https://github.com/DavidBrunow/EmmaCan.com/blob/master/templates/post_article.erb' title='post_article.erb on GitHub'>post_article.erb on GitHub</a>. This allows me to show the caption text on top of the image when it is moused over, and let’s the images speak the rest of the time.</p><p>Next, I created an <a href='https://github.com/DavidBrunow/EmmaCan.com/blob/master/plugins/html5video.rb' title='HTML5 plugin'>HTML5 plugin</a> that I use instead of Don’s video plugin. As I learned after diving into this, HTML5 video is a bit of a pain in its current form, which I attribute to Firefox’s insistence on not supporting the H.264 format. The plugin that I created does not account for this issue and therefore the videos do not show up in Firefox (although I added more hacky javascript to allow them to be downloaded). Not supporting Firefox has given <a href='https://twitter.com/paraboloo/status/355400925713661952' title='my father a reason to troll me'>my father a reason to troll me</a>, but I had to make a decision based upon my particular constraints, and one of those constraints is that I would like to be able to make the posts completely from the file system on my iOS devices. From my research, it isn’t super straightforward to export Ogg Vorbis from the iPhone and even if I did that, I would be using twice as much space to store each video, which is just a waste. I also want to have full control over my videos, and I don’t want to have to log into yet another web service. So for now, HTML5 with no Firefox support is the way I’m going.</p><p>Now a short bit about my experience serving images and videos. I have no prior experience in this area (my current professional work involves sites on an intranet that have little to no media assets) so I was experimenting with serving these assets straight from my server (which is the lowest tier virtual private server at <a href='http://www.midasgreentech.com' title='Midas Green Tech'>Midas Green Tech</a>). With this strategy, my server would become unresponsive shortly after uploading updates to the site. I believe that this is because the server was caching those assets in memory, but I am not completely sure. I next experimented with a CDN, <a href='https://www.cloudflare.com' title='Cloudflare'>Cloudflare</a> to be exact, and the server’s unused memory went up dramatically and load times shortened dramatically. In other words, as convention would tell you, use a CDN.</p><p>The last thing that I modified was Don’s timeago.coffee. I wanted the time stamps on my daughter’s site to display my daughter’s age at the time of the posting, so I created <a href='https://github.com/DavidBrunow/EmmaCan.com/blob/master/items/js/timesince.coffee' title='timesince.coffee'>timesince.coffee</a>. You can provide the script a starting date and it will display how long after the date that that post occurred, with accuracy to a month.</p><h2 id='Conclusion'>Conclusion</h2><p>I am quite pleased with my switch to Magneto for my daughter’s site. I have already posted more times than I did on the previous platform, and more importantly I don’t get that feeling of dread that I usually do when I have to put in a password and navigate a site that I’m not used to navigating. I can almost do everything on my iPhone.</p><p>Would I recommend this setup to someone who is not technically minded? Definitely not. But if you are already managing a Linux server and want to share some pictures and memories with family and friends, or just want to have a memory for yourself, I think this is a great way to go. I might just be putting together another soon, and I will definitely be iterating upon my daughter’s site in order to get it closer to my original concept.</p><p>You can follow me on Twitter <a href='https://www.twitter.com/davidbrunow' title='@davidbrunow'>@davidbrunow</a> where I will post links to any further blog posts about my experience with Magneto. And as a reminder, Magneto was created and open sourced by <a href='https://www.twitter.com/donmelton' title='@donmelton'>@donmelton</a>.</p><p>[^1]: I could make the waiting after clicking much shorter by fully loading all of the content at the beginning, and then using JavaScript to hide and show different “pages”, but that would add more complexity to the site and make the template system generated by Magneto more difficult to use. Scrolling is very natural on the web, and probably the best way to do it.</p><p>[^2]: I do not regret my decision to stop using Squarespace, because of the following benefits of self hosting: 1) I have the content on my local machine and can use it any way that I like, 2) I don’t have to log in, and 3) I can run my daughter’s site on the same server that I run my own which saves me money.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/07-15-estimating-projects", "title": "Estimating Projects", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/07-15-estimating-projects", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’ve had a bad time of creating estimates for projects the last year.

I don’t know if I wasn’t taught or I wasn’t paying attention but the first time I tried on my own I couldn’t get it to light. I learned that there is more to it than putting wood in a pile and applying heat. Now I know that you need to layer the materials in the right way. First the things that are easy to get started — I like to use crumpled up paper for this. The next layer should catch easily but not quite as fast as the first layer.

When I met with her she shared two pieces of advice that have stuck with me, one of which I will share now.</p><p>Her advice was about energy. She said that we only have a few limited resources as a person and that energy was the most important. If you have time but you don’t have energy, like when you are sick, then that time is useless.</p><p>Since energy is a limited and valuable resource, she emphasized that you have to manage your energy expenditures. You have to put yourself in situations that increase your energy and avoid ones that drain you in order to have the biggest impact you can.</p><p>The older I get, the more true this advice becomes. I used to be able to power through any situation — it felt like my energy was unlimited, but maybe I just ignored the signs that I was drained. Now I feel it.</p><p>So what do I do with this advice? I avoid things that drain my energy as much as I can — for me this means avoiding long meetings, traffic, and interruptions.

Recently I’ve been doing woodworking with a friend and I’ve learned the terms flat sawn and quarter sawn.

The cut determines the appearance and physical characteristics of the plank but until I worked with it myself I didn’t think about the connection. It is easy to forget that most of the things around us were something else before — even easier when we are surrounded by plastics and molded metals that don’t resemble their initial state.</p><p>Wood is different.

You could put lots of pretty graphs in the presentation to try to distract from the bad stuff, but you’re smarter than that.</p><p>Actually, you’ve been working towards this moment your entire career.</p><p>The tactic you use is monotony. And big words. And endless droning on about things that no one could possibly care about, but it is all relevant. You make your job look like the most boring thing ever.

Documentation is nothing more than recording how something works so that someone else can figure it out. Despite it being a simple concept it is really hard to do right. Things change constantly and documentation needs to be flexible and dynamic so it can change accordingly. Much of the time this change doesn’t happen or only happens haphazardly and when you want to learn about how something works you have to stumble through the documentation and figure out any gaps yourself or with a Google result from Stack Overflow.</p><p>I read a comment today where someone said that to them the best documentation is a sample program that implements the code you want to teach. That comment made me realize that I’d been assuming that everyone has the same opinion about what good documentation is but obviously that isn’t true. Personally I hate seeing a sample program because the details I want to learn get lost in the noise of the rest of the project. Having a sample program isn’t bad but it certainly isn’t enough — I want the documentation to walk me through common use cases.</p><p>I’ve been thinking about this topic this week because Stack Overflow came out with a new documentation product. They want to do the same thing for documentation that they did for technical questions and provide the place on the internet that people can find the documentation they need. I’ve been an early beta tester of it for a few months but I never had a chance to dig in and check it out. I took some time a few days ago and so far I’m not impressed by what I see but I’m no expert at the right way to build such a thing. Despite that, my complaint is the from what I looked at the documentation was very topic driven — information about a control that can be used in iOS — rather than what I see as more concept driven like how to get started building an app.</p><p>Despite my poor first impression I’m excited about what this new documentation product will be in the future. I’m confident the Stack Overflow team will refine the idea until it is an excellent solution.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/07-24-working-around-the-edges", "title": "Working Around The Edges", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/07-24-working-around-the-edges", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’m reading a book about working with children who have disabilities and one of the most important points the author has made, and repeatedly stated, is that you have to work with them where they are at. You can’t expect them to leap to where you want them to be. Forcing a child to crawl who isn’t ready to do more than wiggle around on the floor does no good and probably does harm. You have to work around the edges of what that child can do and keep expanding those edges.</p><p>This is true of all kids, but it matters much more if a child has a disability that doesn’t allow them to be as resilient as a child without any.</p><p>Today I was thinking about how well that advice works in other parts of our lives.

For example, let’s say you want a website to show members of an organization. We will assume that you already have a website so we don’t have to talk through that complex process in addition to my example.</p><p>So you have a functioning website and you want to add a list of members of an organization. First you have to ask the question, how often will the members of this organization change? Who will be changing them? You run into the first bit of compounding complexity and have to decide whether you should use a database. Now a database really isn’t a complex concept — it is simply an organized way to store and find information, but with it comes another piece of software that needs maintenance and another language to speak to talk to it. Plus you have to find a place to store the data and a way connect it to your website. So let’s keep this simple and avoid the database for this example. We will update members by hand each time they change, which means a little more manual effort but if members don’t change often then avoiding the complexity will be worth it.</p><p>So we use our website software’s built in editor and manually add a few members of our organization in a simple table. Now we want to make it so that clicking on a row of this table shows us more information about that member. We’d prefer to let the user click anywhere on the row instead of having to click directly on the information in the row. Here comes more complexity! To make this table to work the way we want, we need to use a programming language called JavaScript. So we need to know another language and also how to make that language work with our website. We also have to be willing to fix that JavaScript if it breaks for any reason and be sure that it works in all of the 5 most used browsers. We decide to use JavaScript — we think this feature is worth the extra complexity. Now we can click on a row and see more information about a contact.</p><p>The contact information looks pretty good, but there are a few things we’d like to tweak to look a little better. Based upon the theme installed on our website, some of the text is bold where we want it normal weight and we’d like to change some of the colors to highlight important information. We’d also like to change that table that lists all the members so that when someone puts their mouse over one of the rows the row is highlighted so it is easier to see related information. Once again, here comes more complexity! Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to change the style of things on a website. In prepackaged websites like Wordpress and Squarespace you can choose a theme that takes care of most of the CSS for you. But if you want to make a tweak here or there then you need to know yet another language and yet again how to make that language work with the website. We will choose to get the CSS working the way we want it in this situation because we really think changing the styles will make the information make more sense together.</p><p>All of that is a lot to consider for one “little” feature, I mean all we want to do is show a list of members and information about them! I could make a Word document that did that in a few minutes!</p><p>And even with all the complexity I discussed here, I didn’t talk at all about best practices like ensuring your website is secure, that your web pages load fast, that your information is backed up, how to best create and test changes, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Technology is complex by necessity.</p><p>Many systems try to remove, or abstract, away that complexity by limiting your options. That is great for situations where you are OK with those limitations and, frankly, where you are OK with looking like everyone else.</p><p>But the best way to abstract away that complexity is with people. Good people who know the right way to do things, know which details you need to know about and which you don’t, and that genuinely care.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/08-04-straight-talk", "title": "Straight Talk", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/08-04-straight-talk", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>The solution to your problem with another person is to treat them as a person.

We’ve suffered with web based stores and the issues that come along with them, like security of our payment information, having to remember yet another password, and unintuitive and slow-to-load mobile layouts, because the value we get from them is so high.</p><p>Opening a storefront on iOS solves two of those problems immediately because your customers can use Apple Pay which is incredibly secure and already built in to their device. Given the right developer, an iOS app will load much more quickly than the typical website because less information would need to be sent over the network.</p><p>The main problem I see with recommending an iOS based storefront to businesses is that iOS development is pricy. On the web, business owners have more choices than they need between Shopify, Squarespace, Wordpress, and so on. I don’t think it will be long before the same number of options are available as iOS stores and it will be interesting to see if it is the established companies that bring those options or if new companies take over that market.</p><p>Regardless of where it goes, I think it could be a good way to differentiate your business right now and if I had physical products I wanted to sell, I’d open an iOS storefront before one on the web.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/08-06-adapting-taste", "title": "Adapting Taste", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/08-06-adapting-taste", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Some time back I made a significant effort to reduce sugar and salt from my diet.

To that end, Write is designed simply, with no underlying database. The app relies only on the file system in Dropbox and two preferences that are stored about your blogs: the location of the blogs in Dropbox and the index of the blog you are currently viewing.</p><p>This approach has at least one limitation that I have run into so far — since all of the information about your drafts and your posts is stored in memory, a large number of either could overwhelm the relatively small amount of memory available on your iOS device. I have done my best to keep that impact to a minimum.</p><p>My other major design goal was to enable the user to complete the entire drafting and posting process inside the app. That is another reason I created the html5video plugin for my daughter’s site - I can easily and directly take the video on the device and upload it to Dropbox. In this version, any cropping of videos or images must be done in the Photos app, but at least everything can be done on the phone.</p><h3 id='Limitations'>Limitations</h3><p>Since the iOS app is not actually putting the file on your server when you press the “Post” button, some other process must be running to do so. The two options that I know of to do that are to be running Magneto in auto mode on your Mac, or to be running Magneto in auto mode on your server, with the Dropbox files shared to your server.</p><p>Currently, I am doing neither of those — I am manually deploying to my server after posting in the iOS app.</p><h3 id='Walkthrough'>Walkthrough</h3><p>When you first open Write, after connecting to your Dropbox account, you will be shown a list of directories that might contain Magneto sites.</p><p>Upon choosing the site or sites that you want to have available in Write, you are taken to a list of the sites you have selected. You can choose one to see the drafts and posts for that blog.</p><p>Once you have chosen the blog you want to see, you will be shown a list of the file names for your drafts on that blog. Using the segmented controller at the top, you can choose to see the ten most recent posts.</p><p>From this screen, you can choose a draft or post to see and edit the contents, or you can click on the “New Draft” button to create a new draft.</p><p>The view of the draft is simply the content of the markdown file. As you can see in the screenshot, nothing is wysiwyg. It is the exact same thing you would see if you were editing the file in Sublime Text 2 on your Mac.</p><p>As you can see in this next screenshot, I haven’t put anything nice like a keyboard tray with common markdown keys in this version, but probably will in the future. You will also see a “Save” button. That button will upload the file to Dropbox, as will going back to the drafts screen. The file is automatically saved locally every five seconds. I have also included a button to add media, whether an image or a video. As I said before, this button will add the media to your Dropbox and place the proper tag at the cursor location in your file.</p><p>I think I am handling conflict resolution for the versions of files in a conservative manner. If the copy of the file on the local file system was modified after the copy on Dropbox, then Write updates the copy on Dropbox with the local copy. If the local file was modified before the Dropbox copy then Write creates a new “conflicted” version of the file.</p><p>From the draft editing screen, you can choose the “Post” button to move the file from the Drafts folder to the items/current year folder. Choosing that button will change the time stamp in the file to the current time and change the name of the file to the name on the title line, if they differ.</p><h3 id='Conclusion'>Conclusion</h3><p>I hope you find Write useful.</p><p>If you would like to contact me for bug reporting or any other reason, I am on twitter @davidbrunow or you can email me at helloDavid@brunow.org.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2013-08-06T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/08-07-do-no-harm", "title": "Do No Harm", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/08-07-do-no-harm", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I was listening to a Mission Dharma Dharma Talk a couple of days ago and the teacher, Howie Cohn, was discussing the Buddhist principal of doing no harm. He explained it in a way that I hadn’t thought of before and that I found interesting. I’ve been doing my best not to kill things but not doing harm is another step further. The interesting part of what he said was about how my choice to do no harm affects the people around me. If people around me no that I won’t harm them then they can be less guarded, more open, and closer to their true and best selves. That’s an aspect of doing no harm that I’ve never thought of before but I really like the idea.

I really didn’t want to have to do it because it seemed like it was going to be very difficult. My memories of having done it before we’re not pleasant because I’d forced myself through it while I was exhausted. That exhaustion made the task much harder the first time and that impression stuck with me, regardless of my energy levels yesterday. Depending on the day, that impression could have been enough friction for me to put off the task another day.</p><p>I have two ways to reduce the impact of these impressions of difficulty. The first is to avoid putting myself in a situation where I have to work on something when I’m exhausted. That comes down to better estimates, better expectations, and a better job at saying no to extra tasks. This is very difficult when I want to make sure a project is done right and want to spend the time to make sure it is. I’d much rather a project be late and right than on time and awful.</p><p>My second way to reduce the impact of these impressions of difficulty is to be aware of them. Sometimes that’s enough to overcome them.

This is surprisingly difficult due to the complexities of work, the inherent vagueness of projects, and the need to get paid enough to survive. That is one reason why it is so important to work with great people — the care they put into their work bridges the gap between incentives.</p><p>So let’s talk about the incentives with different types of pricing and I am going to specifically talk about pricing in the business to business service industry. I know of three primary pricing models: 1) hourly, 2) fixed bid per project, and 3) retainer.</p><p>I ran out of time to write this due to a meeting this morning, so I’ll break it up into multiple parts. Today I’ll talk about hourly billing.</p><h3 id='Hourly'>Hourly</h3><p>When billing by the hour the client’s incentive is to keep the number of hours low so they don’t have to spend as much money. This can lead to them wanting to cut corners in order to reduce the total price. The service provider’s incentive is to charge for as many hours as possible to increase their income.</p><p>This imbalance of incentives leads to tension and possibly distrust. Unless the client and service provider have a strong relationship, the client doesn’t know if the service provider is recommending things for their own benefit or for the benefit of the client. They don’t know if the service provider is dragging their feet to rack up more hours. As a relationship is built these problems tend to fade but that takes time and consistency on both sides — the same people need to be working together because that trust isn’t easily transferable.</p><p>I feel like hourly billing is a necessary evil. I don’t like it but sometimes that is the only way because the task isn’t easily defined.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/08-11-making-a-hard-decision", "title": "Making A Hard Decision", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/08-11-making-a-hard-decision", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>The first step to making a hard decision is figuring out what questions need to be answered.

In particular I talked about the effect of pricing models, since money is the most important controllable incentive. Today I’m going to go into more detail about the incentives of project based pricing.</p><h3 id='Project-Based-Pricing'>Project Based Pricing</h3><p>Project based, or fixed bid, pricing is the second most common way of billing I’ve seen. The way it works is that a company approaches you and asks for your estimate of how long a project will take. You give them an estimate and that is how much they pay you, regardless of the amount of time you spend on it.</p><p>Project based pricing is really good for the client because they know how much they will be spending up front. They don’t have to worry about their costs ballooning and what they will do in that situation. This form of billing also creates tension between you and the client because the client wants you to do as much as they can get out of you and you want to do as little so that you can have a higher effective bill rate — if a project that you estimate at 40 hours at $100 an hour only takes 20 hours then your effective bill rate is $200 an hour. Yay for you!</p><p>In my experience, consultants hate project based billing. It scares them because it is very difficult to get the estimate right and the $200 effective bill rate situation mentioned above is rare.</p><p>I really like project based billing, partially because I tend to go in the opposite direction as everyone else, and partially because I’m good at what I do and quicker than average.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/08-13-aligning-incentives,-part-3", "title": "Aligning Incentives, Part 3", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/08-13-aligning-incentives,-part-3", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>The last couple of days I’ve been discussing the idea of aligning your incentives to those over your clients as a business providing services to another businesses. I’ve focused on pricing models because the primary, and most easily defined, incentive in these relationships is money. So far I’ve covered hourly billing and project based billing, and today I’ll talk about retainer based billing.</p><h3 id='Retainer-Based-Billing'>Retainer Based Billing</h3><p>In the kind of work I’ve done, retainer based billing is a specialty tool only good for certain situations, like a plumbing key that is only good for opening a sewer cover. I’d love to find a way to make it work for projects because it makes some things much simpler, but I haven’t been able to come up with a way to do that yet.</p><p>In retainer based pricing, your clients pay you an agreed upon amount of money each month to ensure that you’ll be available for them for a certain amount of time that month. No matter how much work you do that month, you get the same amount of money.</p><p>As with project based billing, your client’s incentive is to get as much out of your for that monthly amount as possible. It is good to set their expectations right so that they don’t feel like they aren’t getting what they are paying for, so specify specific amounts of your time that they get per month or certain standards that you’ll meet.</p><p>Your incentive is to spend as little time as possible providing these services for your client which should lead to you doing your best to get things right the first time. Let’s consider two scenarios in which a local book store is having issues with their wireless networking.</p><p>In scenario 1, the book store is paying a company to send out technicians to look at the networking problem and charging by the hour. That technician has no incentive to get the work done right the first time because each time she goes out there she gets more billable hours. She’s probably great at her job and will get it fixed quickly and accurately the first time, but that isn’t always the case.</p><p>In scenario 2, the book store is paying a company to “make sure their network is working right.” They pay the same amount every month regardless of whether a technician has to come out. The company providing that service now has the incentive to do two things that benefit the client: 1) get the network working as quickly as possible if it has issues and 2) hire people that are really good at their job to ensure they get it done in as few hours as possible. Both of those are great for the book store because they need that network up to run their business.</p><p>Retainer based billing also makes invoicing simpler for both sides. Your company sends the same invoice every month. They only have to quickly review it to make sure nothing has changed, rather than go through each line item to make sure it looks right.</p><p>I really like the idea of retainer based billing, but like I said before it only works for a small set of situations. But if you can setup some of those situations you can get a nice steady baseline of cash flowing into your business every month that helps to smooth out the fluctuations you’ll get from your hourly and project based work.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/08-13-companies-should-have-values-like-people", "title": "Companies Should Have Values Like People", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/08-13-companies-should-have-values-like-people", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I couldn’t agree with <a href='http://www.fastcompany.com/3062595/tim-cooks-apple/tim-cook-on-why-apple-still-matters' title='Tim Cook more'>Tim Cook more</a>.

I discussed pricing models as the primary tool for aligning those incentives and discussed how each of three pricing models — hourly, project based, and retainer — affects each party’s incentives.</p><p>After writing each part and reflecting on what I wrote, I noticed that I brought up the topic of tension frequently. I portrayed tension between you and your clients as a bad thing and that’s because I don’t like tension in my life. That doesn’t mean it is a bad thing for you and your business.</p><p>Like any advice, what I write is based upon my experience and my preferences.

Higher profits aren’t my goal.</p><p>For now, that wraps up my series on aligning interests with your clients.

Delivery and transportation services are two of the newer industries which are able to provide much better service than in the past simply because their apps know where you are due to the magic that is GPS.</p><p>This also means that new industries are being introduced to having software bugs in their apps. These bugs can hurt their reputation and cause potential customers to distrust them. Let’s take an example of a flower delivery service that has a slick mobile app that lets you put in a destination address and gives you an estimated cost. You are going big for your significant other’s birthday and want to send them 144 roses. The app estimates that the delivery fee will be $5 and that as an added convenience you won’t be charged until they are delivered. Then you’re charged $29 in delivery fees because apparently the app had a bug where it didn’t add the $2 surcharge for every additional dozen roses. You’re angry and, whether the company was trying to be deceptive or not, you think they lied to you.</p><p>Unfortunately these types of bugs are the last things on a company’s mind when they are launching a new mobile-based service or building a company around it in the first place. The company is probably using a third party vendor for the app and they trust that that vendor did their job right.</p><p>Two takeaways from this:</p><ol><li><p><p>The most important interactions in your app, in this example increasing the number of roses to deliver, need to be tested thoroughly. You need to test them yourself.</p></p></li><li><p><p>You need to ask what your vendors do to test the software they give you. Research any jargon they throw at you so you have a good understanding of what is being done.

People would ask us exactly what that meant and we didn’t really have an answer — it meant everything. If you had something you needed that even barely intersected with technology then we’d handle it. I think this was the right strategy early on for a few reasons. First, it is hard for a small company to find work and the more we offered to do the bigger the pool of potential work. We probably wouldn’t have made it this long without that pool. Second, it has allowed us to see what our target market needs and therefore how much work of different types is available. Third, it has given us the opportunity to try things and see what we like and don’t like. Combined with knowing what kinds of work is out there, this allows us to decide to do the things we are best at and enjoy doing the most (those two seem to go hand in hand.)</p><p>Start broad and narrow over time.

I’d argue that it isn’t to keep people from getting into that thing — it is to know when people have gotten in.</p><p>No lock is impenetrable just as no house can be fully secured. But knowing whether someone has made it inside that house is useful. You can look for stolen items and be on the lookout for an intruder that is still in your house.</p><p>A cheap lock can be picked with simple tools that don’t leave a trace. For many years, computer security has relied on cheap locks that we call passwords. A password can try to keep people out of your things but they are not good at letting you know when someone has broken them.</p><p>I read a fascinating <a href='http://www1.icsi.berkeley.edu/~nweaver/vallejo.pdf' title='criminal complaint'>criminal complaint</a> today about a group that would break into people’s houses and steal their wifi passwords. The group used those passwords to use that person’s internet access for whatever purpose they needed without the activity being traced back to them as easily. The group could have easily used that password to track all the internet activity conducted in that home.</p><p>That is scary stuff and I’d bet that most people’s homes are susceptible to this attack. The default password for the wifi network is long and a pain to guess, but my internet company prints it right on the side of the router so anyone with physical access to it could easily get the wifi password.</p><p>This is scary stuff. What can you do?</p><p>If someone is inside your home, not a lot. Routers have reset buttons on them so someone can change the password back to the default one printed on the side even if you change it to something better. But that is like putting a better lock on your front door, because you’ll know that the password was changed. All the sudden, your devices won’t connect to wifi and you’ll start to wonder why. Even though you can’t stop someone from breaking in in the first place you are in a much better position than if you didn’t know they’d been there.</p><p>Just like you can’t fully secure your home, you can’t fully secure your technology. Work on finding ways to know when your security has failed so you can respond quickly.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/08-23-what-came-before", "title": "What Came Before", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/08-23-what-came-before", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>If it weren’t for Google, we wouldn’t be able to run the business we do.

As a bilingual need — one that can speak both technology and human — I try to do what I can to fix that. For example, I answered a question today that I thought I’d share here, with some paraphrasing:</p><p>Q: I need a website and I heard that Bootstrap  is better than WordPress for mobile. What are your thoughts?</p><p>My Answer: It is difficult to give specific advice without knowing your process for building websites, so I’ll discuss the options in general terms which will either be helpful or lead to more questions that will be helpful :). I’m going to try to explain at a Sesame Street level – not because I think you’re at that level but because I think it helps to get rid of assumptions that could get in the way of understanding.</p><p>To start, Wordpress and Bootstrap are two very different things.</p><p>Wordpress is a Content Management System (CMS) which is a fancy term for a system for storing content and sharing it with others. Content is text, images, videos, and everything else that you might want on a website.</p><p>Bootstrap is a “Mobile First Front-end Framework” which is a fancy term for a template of styles that are primarily meant to be used for websites being displayed mobile devices. Bootstrap also adapts the styles so that websites look right on desktop computers. Bootstrap is used in a similar way to a Wordpress theme – to change the way the website looks.</p><p>Everything Bootstrap or a Wordpress theme does can be done manually if you speak the right language. That language is Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) which is the fancy term used for the format of files used to change the styling of websites. Both Bootstrap and Wordpress themes are collections of CSS files that make the website look right on different screen sizes so the person making the site doesn’t have to do all the work themselves.</p><p>So Bootstrap cannot replace Wordpress because it doesn’t do everything Wordpress does. But it can be used with Wordpress, depending on your Wordpress skills.

I’ve tried to be very intentional about adding complexity to the project and therefore started off simply by not worrying about modularity or organization and instead just putting all of my Swift files into a single Xcode project and letting the flow of creation take me where it would. To keep CI/CD simple I decided to use Xcode Cloud and created a pipeline that would deploy a build to TestFlight every time I merged to <code>main</code>. My simple process was to write a bit of code each day, commit it to <code>main</code>, and then use the TestFlight build to get a feel for what needed to be done next.</p><p>Last week I shipped my first bug that caused a regression in functionality and decided that I’d gotten to the point of complexity where I needed some automated tests. I hadn’t been writing any tests to that point because what I’d built was not complex and because I was still in a highly experimental phase where tests would probably slow down the flow. But I think I hit the tipping point where adding those tests would speed things up by limiting potential backsliding from regressions.</p><p>Before I started writing tests I chose to do some <a href='http://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html' title='yak shaving'>yak shaving</a> so I could implement the module hierarchy that I wanted. Modularizing would allow me to write tests targeted at specific features which I could build and run in isolation as my app grows. So I shaved these yaks to modularize my app using Swift Package Manager:</p><ul><li><p><p>Created a Package.swift file</p></p></li><li><p><p>Defined all my modules and their dependencies in that file</p></p></li><li><p><p>Copied my code to the proper locations for Swift Package Manager</p></p></li><li><p><p>Added that Package.swift to my project</p></p></li><li><p><p>Made API public until the app would successfully build again</p></p></li></ul><p>This is a process I am very familiar with but it still took me some time and I had to be patient with myself while doing it. Part of my mind was wanting me to hurry up and get back to building things because that part of my mind does not like to acknowledge that organizing and tidying up is part of the building process.</p><p>OK so I had modules and now I was ready to add tests. As I mentioned earlier, I’m using the Composable Architecture for this app and since I’m familiar with using it from the day job I only had to do minor refactoring around how I was generating UUIDs to support tests. I started with a test around the regression that I’d found and used the test to troubleshoot the issue. Once that was resolved I finished out tests around the rest of the features in the app.</p><p>One of my modules is a “DesignSystem” module which has UI components with little to no logic in them. Despite the lack of logic I still like to get some coverage on their layout and how they behave in different environments (like light mode, dark mode, and different Dynamic Type sizes) so I added some snapshot tests for that using <a href='https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing' title='Swift Snapshot Testing'>Swift Snapshot Testing</a>.</p><p>I ran all my tests locally and everything passed. 🎉</p><p>Now to get them running on Xcode Cloud. My experience with Xcode Cloud to this point had been simple and easy so I expected the same with adding tests. But my decision earlier to modularize meant that I needed to shave another yak or two — Xcode Cloud wants a specific test target or a test plan to run tests against and after modularizing I have multiple test targets. So I added a test plan I named “AllTests” and included all the test targets in it. This was oddly difficult because apparently there already was a test plan in the project that was automatically generated and I had to delete that one and jump through some other hoops. Eventually I had a test plan that I could use both locally and with my Xcode Cloud tests. I merged the changes to <code>main</code> and waited to see the green checkmark in Xcode Cloud.</p><p>All my snapshot tests failed on Xcode Cloud. 😿</p><h2 id='Figuring-Out-What-Was-Going-Wrong'>Figuring Out What Was Going Wrong</h2><p>My tests were failing and I didn’t know why so I went searching the internet for clues, starting with the issues section of the Swift Snapshot Testing GitHub repo. I found <a href='https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing/discussions/553' title='this issue'>this issue</a> which described what I was seeing and had a lot of discussion including multiple people who had resolved the issue. So I started naïvely implementing things that were suggested in that thread without understanding the fundamentals of the problem. And those things I tried did not work — I needed to learn a bit more about how Xcode Cloud works to be able to understand the conversations on that issue.</p><aside class='note'><p class='label'>Note</p><p><p>While I had to do extra research to figure out what was going on I’d like to give all the credit for this approach to the folks on that GitHub issue, specifically Cameron Cooke and Oliver Foggin.</p></p></p></aside><p>Since the approach I wanted to take mentioned adding a <code>ci_scripts</code> folder I searched for documentation around that and found <a href='https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/writing-custom-build-scripts#Create-the-CI-scripts-directory' title='this documentation for writing custom build scripts on Xcode Cloud'>this documentation for writing custom build scripts on Xcode Cloud</a>. I didn’t care about custom build scripts but this documentation discussed where the <code>ci_scripts</code> folder needed to live, how to create it, and <a href='https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/writing-custom-build-scripts#Add-resources-to-the-CI-scripts-directory' title='this section about resources in custom build scripts'>this section about resources in custom build scripts</a>.

It would be better to extract the common things we want to do for every snapshot test to a separate method to remove that redundancy and have consistent snapshot tests for all of our views.</p><p>I’ve created an extension on <code>XCTest</code> with a method that handles the check for running on CI as well as:</p><ul><li><p><p>Checks that the device or simulator used for creating snapshots has a consistent display scale and OS version</p></p></li><li><p><p>Creates snapshots inside a view controller so we are capturing what the view will look like on device</p></p></li><li><p><p>Creates snapshots in all color schemes (Light Mode and Dark Mode)</p></p></li><li><p><p>Creates snapshots in all Dynamic Type sizes</p></p></li><li><p><p>Disables animations in the view to get more consistent

The one for Rdio broke due to a change they made in their API that I couldn’t respond to quickly enough. The one for music broke due to some combination of beta software on my phone and the debut of Apple Music. So I went back to the standard iOS alarm clock.</p><p>That alarm clock has one great advantage over either of mine — it doesn’t have to be set every night before bed. Not having to remember that was liberating sand I felt as though a burden was lifted off of me.</p><p>But the thrill didn’t last. That alarm clock lacks two features that both of mine have: playing a random song from a playlist and tracking the amount of sleep I’m getting.</p><p>I spent a chunk of time over the last week fixing my alarm clocks and making them better. Using them again instead of the built in alarm clock is a joy.</p><p>It is nice to know that while a little change was nice, I’ve made something that really does work better and brings me joy to use.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/08-31-caching-and-debugging", "title": "Caching and Debugging", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/08-31-caching-and-debugging", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Tonight I fought with an issue for hours that should have taken me minutes. I went into the situation with my normal debugging strategy which involves quickly making changes, seeing results, and then repeating until I’d found the problem.</p><p>But tonight I was dealing with a different kind of situation although I didn’t know it at first. I was dealing with caching, which meant that changes I made didn’t show up immediately. When caching, the server holds on to certain information for a set period of time for the sake of efficiency. It is much easier to hold onto a webpage for a few seconds and then show it again rather than rebuilding the entire page.</p><p>Like I said I didn’t know I was dealing with caching at first and my strategy wasn’t working at all. I made a change, checked for results and nothing happened. That went on for longer than I’d have liked it to but eventually I caught on. Troubleshooting with caching requires patience and attention. With normal debugging you can usually move quickly enough to keep your attention engaged naturally. But with caching you have to remember what you changed last for seconds or minutes. You have to pay attention to whether things have changed in more subtle ways.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/08-31-what-are-you-asking-for", "title": "What Are You Asking For", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/08-31-what-are-you-asking-for", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>If you are entering a competition, contest, or submitting something you created to someone else for approval, what are you asking for?</p><p>Are you asking for money?

Digesting food, processing thoughts, and flexing muscles all use a chemical reaction to achieve their purpose. Knowing about proper nutrition is essential to a healthy life and therefore the concepts behind these chemical reactions have been simplified into 3 macronutrients and calorie counting.</p><p>But this simplification doesn’t work. We are taught that each of these macronutrients is basically interchangeable — that a calorie is a calorie. But that isn’t true. The chemical reactions for different types of calories are different and therefore their outcomes will be different. Sugar intake is the start of a long chain reaction because it changes the chemical state of your body. So many factors are involved that it would be very difficult to know the exact impact.</p><p>But I believe the real problem is figuring out ways to simplify knowledge without going too far. Maybe this is where wearable technologies can help out. If your belt can keep track of the state of the chemical reactions in your digestive system then it can provide contextual information to keep you healthier. Computers are great at taking data like the state of your digestive system, comparing it to other data like all the available foods on the plant, and providing an output.</p><p>This belt would know when you’re low on potassium and recommend a banana. It would be able to help you consistently maintain an equilibrium that should mean a much healthier life, free of unknown chemical chain reactions.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/09-06-what-insight-can-i-provide", "title": "What Insight Can I Provide", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/09-06-what-insight-can-i-provide", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>The more I learn the less I feel I know and therefore the less that I feel like I can give back to anyone else.

Your only tools for the trip are a car and a crude map that you created based upon your previous travels. Most of your navigation will come from reading highway signs and you have no way of anticipating construction, accidents, or detours.</p><p>So you’re planning this trip and I ask you how long the trip will take. How accurate do you think your number will be? Do you think you’d be off my minutes or hours?</p><p>Now imagine your getting close to the end of your road trip but you’re way behind schedule because you ran into multiple detours. And then someone tells you that you should get someone else to help with the driving so you can keep moving through the night rather than stopping to sleep.</p><p>But this new person doesn’t know how to read the map you’ve created. You didn’t think about it needing to be for anyone but yourself. So this new person doesn’t know exactly where you’re going. And this new person also doesn’t know how to drive your car. I don’t know why she doesn’t but she just doesn’t, although she is familiar with the concept.</p><p>So the first few hours of driving together are at a slower pace than you were at because you’re spending some time teaching her how to drive the car. And she can’t drive at night yet because she doesn’t know the way well enough so you aren’t seeing the amount of extra progress you expected. It isn’t long before you’ve realized that she’s not a help and only slowing you down. It isn’t that she’s done something wrong it’s just that she can’t learn what she needs to learn fast enough to make a difference in your drive.</p><p>This situation I’ve described is very similar to software development projects. We don’t have tools to tell us the effect route to avoid trouble and we only have our own experience and ingenuity as a guide. But one anticipated detour in code can easily add hours or days to a project and there is no way to avoid that. The transfer of information between a team is one of the biggest hurdles that needs to be overcome and unfortunately adding a person near the end can only cause harm. But there is one difference between the two scenarios — the time scale.

When I wrote that I had one specific example in mind — the software industry learning from the book publishing industry.</p><p>I’m certain I’m not the first to make a connection between these two businesses because what we do when creating apps is very similar to what authors do when they write books. We each take a bunch of different ideas and concepts and form them together into what we hope is a unified whole. Many times we fail at this, as authors do, and what we make feels like a jumbled mess. The big difference between us and authors is that they can use all of their given language while we can only use the subset that is our programming language.</p><p>Of course the book industry is in decline and may not be able to be saved in the way we know it. But some authors are still thriving in these conditions. Why? Because they’ve built an audience. They have devoted fans who want to see them do well.</p><p>I think that’s how we need to sell software — by selling it to our audience of fans that want to see us do well.</p><p>Hopefully I’ve convinced you that building an audience is the way to succeed. Now you’re wondering how to do that. I’ve got two examples from the software industry which is exactly a statistical sample but it’s a start towards putting information together. These two examples have some things in common and one big difference.</p><p>The first example is Marco Arment. He created the hit app Instapaper. Instapaper is unique amongst apps in that it solved a real problem in a novel way that no one else was solving. The app was and still is really useful.</p><p>Instapaper was Marco’s big break towards building an audience. From that point he continued building it by hosting a few different podcasts and irregularly blogging.</p><p>The second example is David Smith. He is an iOS developer in Virginia and none of his apps are very well known. But he has built an audience slowly over time through his generosity in sharing what he knows and what he is experiencing through his podcasting and blogging.</p><p>I can see two options for you to start building your audience:</p><ol><li><p><p>Make something so great and useful that people can’t ignore it</p></p></li><li><p><p>Generously give your knowledge to as many people as possible through podcasting, blogging, or whatever other medium you can find</p></p></li></ol><p>Either way, people won’t know they like you until they know you. Find ways to let people know you.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/09-18-limits-on-patience", "title": "Limits On Patience", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/09-18-limits-on-patience", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Thinking more about setting limits on patience, I’m nearing my first guideline.

I came up with the idea because I follow a Twitter account, [@DentonPolice](http a://twitter.com/DentonPolice), that posts pictures and a limited amount of information about people that have been arrested by my city’s police.</p><p>Following this account for a while it didn’t take too long to see that the tweets leave out the person’s race and I’d like to have that information so I can figure out what races are arrested for what crimes in our city. I thought it’d be interested.</p><p>So I came up with the idea of a visual database entry system, for lack of a better term. Here’s how it works:</p><ol><li><p><p>User has data that includes a image of some sort — the image could be of a person or a horse or a document of some sort, doesn’t matter too much which. What matters is that that image contains information that can’t easily be put into a database and therefore can’t easily be used for analysis.</p></p></li><li><p><p>User defines the fields that she is interested in capturing, including both the fields she already has and the information she wants to get from the images. In the example from above, I’d define “Name,” “Crime,” and “Potential Race.”</p></p></li><li><p><p>User imports the data she already has, including all the images.</p></p></li><li><p><p>User is presented with each image in order and is able to fill in any missing information and easily go to the next image.</p></p></li><li><p><p>User can export data to CSV or access it through an API.</p></p></li></ol><p>In addition to these steps, the entire application would be hosted online and open to crowdsourcing.</p><p>It seems like a simple concept and that’s why I’m thinking it already exists.

It is funny how that works.</p><p>In case you’re curious, here is my sugar intake for the last week:</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/09-22-market-vs-competitive-risk", "title": "Market Vs Competitive Risk", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/09-22-market-vs-competitive-risk", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>The topic of disruption and the differences between market and competitive risk were discussed on the <a href='http://5by5.tv/criticalpath/158' title='latest Critical Path'>latest Critical Path</a>, which I highly recommend you listen to. I’ve been thinking about this concept and how it can relate to me and to my business.</p><p>Competitive risk is the risk of not getting the outcome you want when in direct competition with one or more other people. For example, your boss leaves the company and everyone in your department is vying to replace her. You are in direct competition with 9 of your peers and your risk of not getting the job is pretty high. Plus, some factors that would make you more eligible are outside your control, such as your tenure with the company.</p><p>Market risk is the risk that you are entering a market that will not provide the outcome you want. For example, you move into a brand new position that has never existed before at your company. You will need to be able to show that your position is valuable over a period of time. You have much more potential in this situation than in the one with direct competition because you aren’t directly competing for resources. You have much more room to grow and blossom.</p><p>My takeaway is that you need to put yourself into positions where you can easily stand out from everyone else. If you’re a technology person in a room of other technology people then you won’t stand out. For any position of any complexity is nearly impossible to objective judge performance so you don’t realistically have a way to say you’re better than anyone else in the room.</p><p>But in a room of physical therapists, you stand out. You aren’t competing, you stand out, and you provide a unique perspective. The only question now is “can you provide value to physical therapists?” And that’s a question that you are able to gauge before you even put yourself in that room.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/09-22-your-real-job", "title": "Your Real Job", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/09-22-your-real-job", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>You probably have a title that describes the sorts of things that you do on a day to day basis.

The person knows where you are (and therefore where you aren’t.) She can infer why you are in a position from knowing your position so she doesn’t feel anxious about what’s going on.</p><p>Client service needs the same fundamental rule.

Last week I hit the sickness part of the cycle at the perfect time. I was taking a couple of days off work for a conference which meant that I didn’t try to power through getting work done while sick. The conference was intended as inspiration for creatives and I was still able to watch much of it through a live stream. I heard things I’ve heard before and always said “that’s a good idea” but never really took action on. I would always bow to the “realities” of life — that sounds fine for that guy, but he doesn’t have things going on like I do. I’ve got bills to pay and roofs to put over heads and student loans to pay.</p><p>During that sickness and resting period I read the quote above and I felt that it was describing this part of my life. I keep going through this cycle because I keep running away from this problem. I keep looking at everyone else around me as the problem when the problem is me. The problem is how I handle overwork and saying no. I want to do everything — and rightly so, there are millions of amazing things to do — but I cannot do so without hurting myself and making myself miserable. I have limits, I am not Superman. The world will always ask more of me as it does of all talented people. I have to handle that.</p><p>So I’m changing my attitude. I’m not going to be David-do-anything. I’m not going to always get the job done when no one else can and hurt myself by pulling all nighters just to maintain an image. During more intense periods of work other things will need to bend, but not my important other things like sleep and movement and time with loved ones. Meetings and commuting and that sort of things can bend. One on ones with my team members are crucially important, but can be pushed for the short term to ship something for a client.</p><p>One of the speakers (I believe it was <a href='https://mobile.twitter.com/leesteffen' title='Lee Steffen'>Lee Steffen</a> during Panel 02) at that conference I mentioned said that life is like juggling different balls: work, friends, family, health, and sprituality. He said that all those balls are made of glass, other than work. Work can bounce, work will recover. If you are like me and don’t ever let the work ball drop then you are probably cracking the other balls. Let the work ball bounce and see what happens.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/09-29-your-hip-bone-is-connected-to-your", "title": "Your Hip Bone Is Connected To Your", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/09-29-your-hip-bone-is-connected-to-your", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I think it is easy to forget how interrelated everything is.

The problem is that we’ve forgotten what it feels like when everything is running smoothly so we need to retrain ourselves — we need to show our bodies the right way to move and put ourselves into the right postures that setup the correct geometries so we know when things are off and we can correct early instead of after our body has found a way to work around the imbalance.</p><p>So how do we do that? I’m sure there are many ways that I haven’t tried. I bet the movements in yoga would work well. I can tell you what works for me is the exercises in Pete Egoscue’s book series called <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Pain-Free-Revolutionary-Stopping-Chronic/dp/0553379887' title='Pain Free'>Pain Free</a>.

This doom will be brought about by content blockers stopping advertising revenues. I’m going to have to listen to the podcast again to make sure I heard his point correctly, but even if I didn’t I think there’s an interesting thought experiment in the idea (and I’m completely ignoring any thoughts about the web going away right now, but that is very interesting too.)</p><p>If advertisers stopped paying to advertise on the web, where would they choose to advertise instead. Ads have been proven to shape consumer behavior so it is unlikely that advertisers will just stop paying for them. Their budgets won’t decrease, at least not immediately, so they’ll have money to spend. What medium will they choose? Especially now that TV, radio, and newsprint are each struggling to stay alive.</p><p>Will they choose apps, podcasts or push more dollars towards streaming video ads? I have no idea. But it’s an interesting thing to think about.

In the comments to one of those posts, <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndjackkearneysr' title='Jack Kearney'>Jack Kearney</a>, one of my fellow Little DOCC-ers and Independent Representative for <a href='http://www.fallbrookcapital.com' title='Fallbrook Capital Securities Corporation'>Fallbrook Capital Securities Corporation</a> stated that he agreed with the overall premise of my posts and that he had more insight from his experience that he’d like to share. So I met with him a few weeks ago and today I’d like to share some highlights from that conversation.</p><p>First, I need to make a correction. Jack pointed out that he’d describe what I called a retainer as a subscription, and I fully agree with him on that. I won’t change the wording in the initial post but I will add a link to this post as a correction.</p><p>The services we are offering to clients is a monthly subscription to our services.</p><p>A retainer is different. A retainer is an up-front fee from one party to another. The retainer serves one primary purpose in two different ways: to ensure that the hiring party is serious enough to put money towards the relationship which also means that they have something to lose if they don’t follow through.</p><p>A retainer alone doesn’t align incentives. In Jack’s industry, incentives are aligned through a commission system. He is incentivized to do as well as he can for his client so he can get the highest commission and the commissions can be structured to provide even more incentive by increasing the percentage of payout at different tiers. For example, the first $5 could have a 5% commission, the second $5 could have a 7% commission, and the third $5 could have a 9% commission.</p><p>Commissions work well for his industry because the outcomes are binary — his business is to help companies get bought by other companies. The outcome is “the company sold for XX dollars.” Commission systems work very well with clear outcomes.</p><p>I can’t think of a way to make commissions work in the technology services industry because the outcomes are not binary. It is difficult to directly measure the benefits of having a great website or app. But maybe, with the right amount of effort and planning, a commission based system could be setup because being able to tell someone “I will make you this much money and only want this much of it” is a great way to both get buy in and align incentives. I’ll keep thinking about it in case I can figure something out.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/10-04-automated-testing", "title": "Automated Testing", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/10-04-automated-testing", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’ve never been a proponent of automated testing. I don’t believe in Test Driven Development and I’ve never written tests for my code. Despite that, I’ve shipped high quality code that I’ve been able to maintain without worrying about breaking things.</p><p>I attribute my ability to not break things to two factors: 1) I generally work alone on projects so I’m the only one touching the code, and 2) I don’t use any sort of refactoring tools and if I need to refactor I do it all myself so that once again I’m the only one touching the code.</p><p>This has worked really well for me. So well that I wondered why anyone would spend time making tests and thinking “leave it to software developers to come up with a solution to bad code that involves writing more code.”</p><p>But recently I’ve changed my mind about automated testing. I can see how it can find bugs that get introduced into your code and how it can provide peace of mind. I changed my mind because I had to do automated refactoring — so I wasn’t the only one touching the code — and my code got broken.</p><p>Fortunately the app that got broken was still in beta so the issues were caught quickly with minimal impact. And if I’d spent a little more time testing the app after the changes then I’d have found the broken parts before the tester. But if I’d had automated tests in my code I would have known where the issues were immediately after the automated refactoring.</p><p>So I’m going to start getting more familiar with testing. I still don’t believe that Test Driven Development is the right system, at least not for new projects, so I probably won’t adopt that. And I probably won’t write tests in every environment — if I’m the only one writing code and I’m not using automated refactoring then tests are just more overhead and more code that could have bugs.</p><p>But now at least I can understand the point of them and see the value they can provide in peace of mind alone.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/10-05-if-you-didn't-make-it", "title": "If You Didn’t Make It", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/10-05-if-you-didn't-make-it", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>If you didn’t make it then you don’t own it.

The author is against software estimation, mostly because he doesn’t believe that it is accurate. Due to this inaccuracy and trying to manage this extent of inaccuracy we are embarrassing ourselves in front of our customers and wasting huge amounts of time trying to stick to an estimate. The author wants to do away with estimates.</p><p>I completely agree with him that software estimates are not accurate. A few months ago I underestimated a project by a factor of three — it took me three times longer than I expected. And since our company’s philosophy is that our clients should know the most they are going to pay up front, we ate the time for that mistake. That isn’t the only time I’ve gotten an estimate wrong, either — I know the pain of software estimates.</p><p>But unfortunately they are the best we’ve got. From a software developer’s point of view it might make sense to discard estimates. We definitely don’t make estimates and timelines for our company’s internal projects. But we are in the nice position of only burning our time when we make software — we don’t have to worry about any employees’ salaries or health benefits or making sure they can feed their families because it’s just the two of us.</p><p>Most businesses don’t have that luxury. They have real budgets which they depend on for survival. They need to know how much they will be paying for something and estimates are the best we have right now.</p><p>I wish we had a better way, but I can’t think of one. Somehow we’d have to remove money as a factor and that doesn’t seem possible.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/10-15-it's-not-you,-it's-them", "title": "It’s Not You, It’s Them", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/10-15-it's-not-you,-it's-them", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’m a type of person who doesn’t like letting others down.

I can easily get myself worked up into wanting a certain device due to a combination of the way it has been marketed to me and the way that I’ve marketed it to myself.</p><p>When I was in my teens I got myself really excited about OS/2 Warp. You’ve probably never heard of it, but it was a computer operating system. I can’t remember the exact selling points that made me want it so badly but I think it had to do with multitasking or a better user interface. Who knows now.</p><p>I finally bought OS/2 and I was so excited. I installed it on my first computer, which was a 386 and I’m sure I was giddy throughout the entire installation process. And when it was complete, I asked myself “ok self, now what can I do with this?” And I didn’t have an answer.</p><p>That wasn’t the last time that I was beguiled by my geeky desires into buying something that I didn’t have a use for, but fortunately I’ve grown wary of those temptations. Now, if I can’t answer exactly what I want to do with something then I can usually resist.</p><p>But my point isn’t that you should resist technology. My point is that if you are creating technology then you need to show people what they can do with it. You’ll easily seduce geeks with specs and smooth, chamfered aluminum, but most people just don’t care. They care about how it will fit into their life and make their life better.

All this pain happened over a single week around a month ago.</p><h3 id='Bumping-into-macOS-Sonoma'>Bumping into macOS Sonoma</h3><p>I published my blog post on using snapshot tests with Xcode Cloud and everything was working great with tests passing both locally and remotely. Since I have been using snapshot tests for a while that was a bit surprising to me, but I’ll touch on why that is a bit later. Days or weeks went by, I’d made changes that I no longer remembered (or maybe the world changed around me), and my snapshot tests were no longer passing on Xcode Cloud. I was especially upset by this because I’d recently shared that blog post about how to get things working and felt guilty for spreading misinformation.</p><p>Once I got some time to look into the issue I realized that one of two things had happened:</p><ol><li><p><p>I had changed the Xcode Cloud environment to run on macOS Sonoma, or</p></p></li><li><p><p>The latest version of macOS Sonoma changed the behavior of the snapshots</p></p></li></ol><p>Basically, the issue had to do with running my snapshot tests on macOS Sonoma on Xcode Cloud (running on Sonoma locally to record the snapshots seems fine) which had just made it to the release candidate stage. Changing the Xcode Cloud environment back to macOS Ventura resolved the issue and I was able to move on knowing that I had not completely misled people.</p><h3 id='Bumping-into-TabView'>Bumping into TabView</h3><p>Someone in the Point-Free Slack mentioned that the snapshots they generated of their tab bar did not look correct. I hadn’t tried creating snapshots for the tab bar in my app, so I hadn’t run into the issue before, but I was quickly able to reproduce. The snapshots looked like this (the unselected tab bar icons are white which makes them very difficult to see):</p><p><picture><source media='(prefers-color-scheme: light)' srcset='../../images/Brunow/miscoloredTabBar@3x.png 2x'><img alt='Screenshot of my app’s miscolored tab bar.

As long as Apple always supports macOS Ventura then I don’t need to worry about the issue with Sonoma, right?</p><p>But throughout these fights I’d been ignoring a glaring issue with the snapshots of the SwiftUI <code>List</code> in my app. Take a look at this monstrosity:</p><p><picture><source media='(prefers-color-scheme: light)' srcset='../../images/Brunow/misrenderedSwiftUIList@3x.png 2x'><img alt='Screenshot of a SwiftUI List in my app. Each row in the list has slightly rounded corners that make it look goofy.' srcset='../../images/Brunow/misrenderedSwiftUIList@3x.png 2x' src='../../images/Brunow/misrenderedSwiftUIList@3x.png' /></source></picture></p><p>OK maybe calling it a monstrosity is harsh. And the contrast between the light gray and the white is not great so the issue may be difficult to see, but each row in the <code>List</code> has rounded corners instead of only the top leading, top trailing on the first item and bottom leading and bottom trailing on the last item having rounded corners. What is going on there?</p><p>I tried a lot of different things to try to get this to render properly.</p><p>I thought that perhaps it was a timing issue and the UI needed more time to layout so I increased the wait time before capturing the snapshot. Nope.</p><p>I thought that maybe the wait time wasn’t enough and that I needed to increase the speed of the animations so I tried setting the <code>window.layer.speed = 100</code>.

That property I linked to on <code>UIApplication</code> is deprecated since Apple no longer wants us to think about an application having a single window and instead to think in terms of a multi-window world, but that deprecation doesn’t matter for our purposes since the concept of a key window is still valid.</p><p>A host application is an application within which we can run our tests. This gets a bit complex in the current Apple ecosystem when you choose to use Swift Package Manager to modularize your dependencies like I did in the last blog post. Swift packages have no concept of a host application and therefore tests in Swift packages cannot be run inside a host application. Since I’m building an iOS app I have a host application at my disposal which I can use and I’ll talk about how to do that a bit later. For now, let’s get back to these two different methods for creating snapshots of our user interface.</p><aside class='note'><p class='label'>Note</p><p><p>The host application story for Swift packages could be improved and I’m not the first to notice that — <a href='https://forums.swift.org/t/host-application-for-spm-tests/24363' title='this thread on the Swift forums'>this thread on the Swift forums</a> was started in 2019. While I like to take action to try to improve the little parts of the world that I can, I’m not sure what action to take here.</p></p></p></aside><p>What we’ve seen so far is two conditionals with two branches each and therefore 4 different ways that snapshots could theoretically be captured (based upon the conditional’s logic only 3 of these possibilities can actually be used in the snapshot testing library but I think it is useful to think through them all):</p><table><thead><tr><th scope='col'><p>Method</p></th><th scope='col'><p>Window</p></th><th scope='col'><p>Configurable without code changes</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><code>drawHierarchy</code></p></td><td><p><code>UIWindow()</code></p></td><td><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>drawHierarchy</code></p></td><td><p>Key window</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>render</code></p></td><td><p><code>UIWindow()</code></p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>render</code></p></td><td><p>Key window</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Then my followup question to that table is “do any of these configurations fix the bad behavior I’m seeing with my <code>List</code>?” (I had to modify the snapshot testing code to test the first “impossible” configuration):</p><table><thead><tr><th scope='col'><p>Method</p></th><th scope='col'><p>Window</p></th><th scope='col'><p>Fixes <code>List</code></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><code>drawHierarchy</code></p></td><td><p><code>UIWindow()</code></p></td><td><p>Yes*</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>drawHierarchy</code></p></td><td><p>Key window</p></td><td><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>render</code></p></td><td><p><code>UIWindow()</code></p></td><td><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><code>render</code></p></td><td><p>Key window</p></td><td><p>No</p></td></tr></tbody></table><aside class='note'><p class='label'>Note</p><p><p>I added the asterisk on the first line because while the <code>List</code> was rendered properly the tab bar’s tabs were not properly positioned as you can see in this diff where the tab bar is positioned too low in the view: <picture><source media='(prefers-color-scheme: light)' srcset='../../images/Brunow/diffBetweenDrawHierarchyKeyWindowUIWindow@3x.png 2x'><img alt='Shows difference between the snapshot taken with the key window and the snapshot taken with a UIWindow.

We’ve already looked at the Apple documentation and I didn’t see any clues there as to the underlying reason behind the differences in behavior — that documentation did not even mention the difference in <code>UIAppearance</code> mentioned by the snapshot testing documentation.</p><p>After some internet searching I found <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/25704861' title='this interesting StackOverflow post'>this interesting StackOverflow post</a> that talks about the implementation differences between those two methods:</p><aside class='note'><p class='label'>Note</p><p><p>The method <code>drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates:</code> performs its operations on the GPU as much as possible, and much of this work will probably happen outside of your app’s address space in another process. Passing YES as the afterScreenUpdates: parameter to <code>drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates:</code> will cause a Core Animation to flush all of its buffers in your task and in the rendering task. As you may imagine, there’s a lot of other internal stuff that goes on in these cases too.</p></p></p></aside><aside class='note'><p class='label'>Note</p><p><p>In comparison, the method <code>renderInContext:</code> performs its operations inside of your app’s address space and does not use the GPU based process for performing the work…This route is not as efficient as it does not use the GPU based task. Also, it is not as accurate for screen captures as it may exclude blurs and other Core Animation features that are managed by the GPU task.</p></p></p></aside><p>So the <code>render(in:)</code> method is both less efficient and creates less accurate results!?! 😲 Why would we want to consider it as an option?</p><p>Well, as we noted before, the <code>drawHierarchy</code> method only works when the tests are hosted in an application. And as I mentioned before, at this point in time there is no way for a Swift package’s tests to be hosted in an application without a separate Xcode project. The <code>render(in:)</code> method is the only choice to use image based snapshot tests in a Swift package. Running tests inside of a host application is also much slower than running them standalone and folks might want to make that tradeoff of accuracy for test speed.</p><aside class='note'><p class='label'>Note</p><p><p>I’ve created a <a href='https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing/discussions/797' title='discussion'>discussion</a> around whether <code>drawViewHierarchy</code> should be the default codepath if the tests are being run inside a host application.</p></p></p></aside><p>I think it is also worth noting that neither of these API were created with the intent of supporting snapshot testing. Without intentional support of that use case we can’t expect the Apple folks working on those API and supporting them across OS versions, processor architectures, and everything else changing to ensure that they work for this purpose. That being said, I believe that Apple should consider snapshot testing to be a first-class use case for these API (or to provide separate API for that purpose) and therefore I’ve filed <a href='https://github.com/feedback-assistant/reports/issues/430' title='FB13292311'>FB13292311</a> for that.</p><h2 id='Rough-edges-in-low-level-general-libraries'>Rough edges in low-level, general libraries</h2><p>As I’ve mentioned before I think the Swift Snapshot Testing library is very good. But I’ve also typed a fair number of words and spent a large amount of time working around these rough edges on the API. How can I think it is a good library and think it has rough edges? Do I have a poor sense of quality?</p><p>I may have a poor sense of quality elsewhere (I did once watch an entire movie about a homicidal tire named Robert) but I don’t think that is the case here. These rough edges come from two things: 1) the library authors are building upon lower level things that have rough edges, and 2) the library is low-level and general purpose.</p><p>The only way to cover over rough edges in the things that you are building on top of is to make decisions for the end users of the library. But making those decisions for the end users takes away the end users’ power and flexibility. Like most engineering, this is a trade-off and I think the authors of this library made the right choice. My only minor gripe would be that, as I mentioned before, the documentation around these trade-offs is lacking and therefore I, as an end user of this library, am not able to make as informed of a decision as I would like.</p><h2 id='Using-strong-opinions-in-higher-level-libraries'>Using strong opinions in higher level libraries</h2><p>If I know my end users (or if I’m my own end user) then I can make informed decisions for them which will cover over most of the rough edges from the lower levels without taking away the power they need. There will be exceptions, like the rendering differences in macOS Sonoma on Xcode Cloud, but the experience can be much simpler. The trade-off here is that I need to ensure the environment the end user is working in matches the expectations of my strong opinions — they need to have their tests setup the proper way and have them hosted inside an application.</p><p>But even my strongest opinions can’t cover over all the issues and it is in those cases that we need to provide other ergonomics. For example, if you capture your golden snapshot on a simulator that renders at a display scale of <code>@3x</code> and then run a follow-up test on a simulator that renders at a display scale of <code>@2x</code> the test will fail. Similar failures will happen with different iOS versions due to minor differences in text layout, and with different simulators based upon the size of their status bar. In those cases we can find way to gently nudge the user onto the right path.</p><p>Even this approach has some flaws. After I finished that paragraph I went to test out a change to see if I could make my library more ergonomic when a simulator was set to a different language and found that all my tests were failing. Apparently if Arabic is in the list of languages — even if it isn’t the default language — the simulator will render differently. Now that I’ve figured that out I can add a check for that to the library but I can never be sure that I’ve covered every rough edge.</p><aside class='note'><p class='label'>Note</p><p><p>I went down a long path to try to create an example project that would show the issue of the simulator rendering differently when Arabic is in the list of preferred languages. Some ways down that path I asked myself “does this happen on device as well?” and, <em>turns out</em>, the answer is yes. I was going to file a Feedback about this but I think the behavior, while unexpected to me, is correct. If an app knows that a user prefers Arabic then they might need to show Arabic text in their app and therefore they need the SF Arabic font and the extra vertical height it has.</p><p>This led me to think “which other languages might behave similarly?” I have not tested every language to find out but I did identify another language that changes the rendering like Arabic does. I started on this <a href='https://developer.apple.com/fonts/' title='Apple website about their fonts'>Apple website about their fonts</a> which describes a category of SF Script Extensions into which SF Arabic falls. I tested the other script extensions and found that Armenian behaves similarly to Arabic.</p></p></p></aside><h2 id='My-opinions'>My opinions</h2><ul><li><p><p>All snapshot tests should be hosted.</p></p></li><li><p><p>All snapshot tests should use <code>drawHierarchyInKeyWindow = true</code>.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Snapshots should usually be generated on the latest device/OS combination.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Snapshots should fail early, with a helpful failure method, when the snapshot environment is different than we expect.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Every view should be snapshotted in the same set of standard environments.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Users should have the option to create a “throwaway” snapshot for situations where dependencies or caches need to be setup to capture the right data.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Snapshots should be rendered on a small device size to be able to find layout issues at that size.</p></p></li></ul><p>Next let’s talk about how to setup the environment for these opinions and the helper code I’ve created to work with them.</p><h3 id='Setting-up-hosted-tests'>Setting up hosted tests</h3><p>Hosted tests need to live inside an app’s XCProject or XCWorkspace and need their own target. Here are the steps to set up the hosted tests:</p><ol><li><p><p>Create a “Unit Testing Bundle” target. This could be named “SnapshotTests” if you want to limit the scope of the kinds of tests that will be in this target or you could name it “Hosted Tests” since there might be other tests you want to write in the future that won’t be snapshot tests but will need to be hosted. One example would be live implementation tests for code that interacts with the keychain. Make sure that your app is selected as the “Target to be Tested” because this is what makes the tests hosted.</p></p></li><li><p><p>If you have existing snapshot tests in your Swift package, copy them into the folder created for the new test target. If you don’t have existing snapshot tests then create the tests in that folder.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Add the Swift Snapshot Testing dependency to the app project. Ensure that it is only added to the test target and not to the app target.</p></p></li><li><p><p>If using TCA, ensure that the app’s logic is not being run at the same time as the snapshot tests by wrapping the code that creates the store with <code>if _XCIsTesting == false { }</code>.</p></p></li><li><p><p>Add the tests in the test target to the test plan.</p></p></li><li><p><p>If you’re using Xcode Cloud for CI, update the <a href='../../documentation/brunow/08-30-snapshot-testing-with-xcode-cloud.html'>Create a symlink in the ci_scripts directory to where our snapshots are stored</a> to point to the new location for snapshots.</p></p></li></ol><p>Now that we have setup hosted tests we have no excuse for not using accessibility snapshot tests. Unfortunately adding them is a little more complicated than simply importing the <a href='https://github.com/cashapp/AccessibilitySnapshot' title='library'>library</a> because nothing in technology is easy.</p><h3 id='While-were-at-it-lets-setup-accessibility-snapshot-tests'>While we’re at it, let’s setup accessibility snapshot tests</h3><p>Before we get into setting up the accessibility snapshot tests let me give you a quick sales pitch for them. Accessibility snapshot tests give anyone who uses them a superpower. That superpower is to be able to look at a user interface and know how a VoiceOver user would experience that user interface. Here’s an example:</p><p><picture><source media='(prefers-color-scheme: light)' srcset='../../images/Brunow/accessibilitySnapshotTestExample@3x.png 2x'><img alt='Accessiblity snapshot showing a snapshot of the user interface on the left. The snapshot of the user interface has colored rectangles over different elements which match up to the VoiceOver text that will be spoken for that element on the right.' srcset='../../images/Brunow/accessibilitySnapshotTestExample@3x.png 2x' src='../../images/Brunow/accessibilitySnapshotTestExample@3x.png' /></source></picture></p><p>This snapshot isn’t perfect – the order of the items in the navigation bar is incorrect, they should be announced before the list rather than after (I created <a href='https://github.com/cashapp/AccessibilitySnapshot/issues/168' title='an issue on the Accessibility Snapshot Testing library'>an issue on the Accessibility Snapshot Testing library</a> for this). But even with that flaw this is fantastic – I can easily see that the order of the elements inside each row doesn’t make sense. The name and quantity should be grouped together because that is related information that shouldn’t be interrupted by the edit button. The alternative to these accessibility snapshot tests is either firing up Accessibility Inspector or building to device with VoiceOver on and manually stepping through each element. And as a reviewer on a pull request who probably doesn’t have time to do that for every review this tool is fantastic.</p><p>Anyhow, I hope I’ve convinced you to at least try the accessibility snapshot tests and we can move on to adding them to our hosted tests.</p><p>Our first step is to add the Accessibility Snapshot Testing dependency to our app project, and specifically the hosted tests target (just like for the snapshot testing dependency). But unfortunately the current version of the Accessibility Snapshot Testing library does not support precision or perceptual precision which are both things we need since we are working across Apple Silicon and Intel machines and each of those machines renders things just differently enough to not completely match snapshots from the other processor type (not needing to set these precision parameters in my first blog post was the surprising thing I alluded to near the beginning of this post). Those things cannot easily be added to the library because:</p><ol><li><p><p>Accessibility Snapshot Testing supports CocoaPods, and</p></p></li><li><p><p>Swift Snapshot Testing dropped support for CocoaPods at the same time it added perceptual precision</p></p></li></ol><p>To work around this I’ve <a href='https://gist.github.com/DavidBrunow/9aade5980649c660d73795d7c9b5b056' title='created a shim'>created a shim</a> inspired by <a href='https://github.com/cashapp/AccessibilitySnapshot/pull/143' title='this pull request'>this pull request</a>.</p><p>This allows us to set the precision and perceptual precision on our accessibility snapshots. Next I’ll share the code that implements my opinions and ties everything together.</p><h3 id='My-opinionated-helper-code'>My opinionated helper code</h3><p>This mostly builds upon the <a href='../../documentation/brunow/08-30-snapshot-testing-with-xcode-cloud.html'>Creating Something Reusable</a> but adds “throwaway” and accessiblity snapshots and provides values for precision and perceptual precision that work consistently for me. This helper has strong opinions and does not provide the user with a lot of flexibility — and where there is flexibility the API provides a default value so that most of the time users would not have to think about those options. Hopefully making these decisions for the user provides a simpler user experience that “just works”.</p><p>Here is a <a href='https://gist.github.com/DavidBrunow/abb67bb0dda59d9524ae9868c926e810' title='gist with my helper code'>gist with my helper code</a>. Note that some of the decisions I’ve made may not work for you. For example, I’ve added a check to make sure that the first preferred language on the simulator running the tests is English (US). This is because I am an American and the primary language I use is American English and this ensures that I don’t accidentally get to a place where all my tests are failing with an extra “u” in the word “color” if I’ve set my simulator’s primary language to English (UK). The tests will still fail with this check but they will fail with a useful error message. You may want to change that check to test for your preferred language.</p><p>This helper uses another <a href='https://gist.github.com/DavidBrunow/c7fa841ecd61526a660367c32a093a0c' title='helper extension on UIDevice'>helper extension on <code>UIDevice</code></a> which I pulled from <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/26962452' title='Stack Overflow'>Stack Overflow</a> to be able to check whether the right simulator is being used for the snapshots.</p><p>These two helpers and the shim I created for accessibility snapshot testing all need to be copied into your hosted tests target.</p><p>Using these helpers, this is what the callsite for running the standard tests would look like:</p><div data-syntax=\"swift\" class=\"code-listing\">\n  <div class=\"container-general\">\n    <pre><code><span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"1\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">...</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"2\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  assertStandardSnapshots(</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"3\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">    content: Text(&quot;I am going to be snapshot!&quot;),</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"4\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">    named: &quot;Sample Text&quot;</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"5\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">  )</span></span>\n<span class=\"code-line-container\"><span data-line-number=\"6\" class=\"code-number\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><span class=\"code-line\">...</span></span>\n</code></pre>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2023-10-21T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/10-21-integrated", "title": "Integrated", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/10-21-integrated", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Small teams that know each other well are the best at creating integrated, cohesive, and great things.

I was working with a team of volunteers, high visibility vests, and a couple of walkie talkies. Our job was to spot what was written on a car’s windshield and based upon that direct them to the right place.</p><p>Yesterday morning was gray and mostly rainy so we had to make adjustments — the water soluble markers for writing on the cars’ windshields wouldn’t work on the outside so they were put on the inside. Due to that constraint and the low amount of light from the gray skies, the writing on the windshields was difficult to read at any distance. We had to figure out a walkie talkie system on the fly to let our team members that were furthest away know what was coming towards them. But after only a few misdirected cars, we got the hang of that.</p><p>The tougher problem for me was communicating with the drivers and I tried out several different strategies for showing them their destination. I tried pointing to the sign that they needed to drive towards which had letters of the alphabet that most likely weren’t their name. I think that didn’t work well because the signs were behind the a-pillars of their car. I tried telling them to follow the vehicle in front of them by providing its make and model. I tried pointing to members of the team that could direct them better. I tried lots of different ways to get them where they needed to be.</p><p>I was trying to think as though I were in the car with them and seeing what they saw but I wasn’t great at doing that some of the time. I found that it was easier to give too much information rather than too little — a person driving in a parking lot in the rain with people and trees all around are already overwhelmed. It doesn’t take too much more information to push them over the edge where they aren’t even listening to you.</p><p>My lesson from this is when trying to guide or teach someone you need to give them the right amount of information for them at that moment. If you’re going to get it wrong, which you probably will, then err on the side of giving less information to avoid overwhelming them. They can always ask for more.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/10-26-why-do-i-like-it", "title": "Why Do I Like It", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/10-26-why-do-i-like-it", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I don’t know much about the recommendation algorithms used at Pinterest or Instagram but in my experience they aren’t very good.

I replied and thought the topic would be good for a blog post, which I’ve adapted from the email.</p><p>In essence, the code that we write is just a directory of files that tell the computer what to do. We try to separate out different parts of the application into different files – for example we have one file that tells the computer how to do anything having to approvers – so that we can more easily reason about the application’s logic, so we only have to fix bugs or add features in one place, and so we have fewer issues with two people modifying the same file. Despite these efforts, if two people are working on two separate features at the same time then each of them can possibly make changes to the same files.</p><p>If those two people were both working on the same files in the same folder then they would constantly be causing problems with what the other was trying to do, similar to the problems you run into if you are trying to modify an Excel spreadsheet at the same time as someone else and you get locked out or lose changes. Whoever saved last would have their changes in the file and the other person’s changes would be discarded. To avoid this problem, each of us works on our own version of the files on our own computer. We use a software called Git to help us manage which version of the code is on our computer and it also helps us share the code between each other. Git also takes care of taking two versions of a file that two people have both made changes to and making them into one version.</p><p>The problem we are running into now is that we can only have one version of the files on the UAT server at a time. When I put my version out there it overwrites the other person’s version and their features are no longer available. The best way to solve this problem is to coordinate which testing will be happening at which time.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/11-02-october-daily-learning", "title": "October Daily Learning", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/11-02-october-daily-learning", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’ve fallen out of a few habits lately and my daily learning is one of them.

Both David and Marco are indie iOS developers, meaning that they are not part of a big company and they make iPhone and iPad apps.</p><p>Their primary discussion on the show was about making money in the App Store and they brought up some great points, like how many developers want the world to work a certain way rather than changing their business strategy to how the world actually is. They talked about how each of them adapted to the world. Marco rode the first waves in the App Store and was able to charge higher prices at the beginning and has since moved to different sales models including free up front with in app purchase and now patronage. David has attacked the problem another way, building a wide variety of apps that offer less utility but have advertisements integrated.</p><p>Both of them have adapted their strategies as times changed and both have been successful.</p><p>But they didn’t mention another factor that I think is the most critical to their success. They are both podcasters.</p><p>From my own experience, I have given them money for apps and services because I “know” them from their podcasts. I’ve listened to every episode of David Smith’s Developing Perspective and all of Marco’s Build and Analyze. After all that time listening to them I feel a connection, as silly as that might sound since I am a nobody to them.</p><p>There is something about listening to a human voice that brings you closer to that person in a way that the written word doesn’t quite match. Through your voice you can build a fanbase of people that want to see you succeed, and you could also call it a personal brand or audience — it is all the same. What it comes down to is people trusting you which leads to them wanting to see you succeed and going out of their way to help you do so.</p><p>Put yourself out there, be generous, and share who you are and what you know regularly. Slowly build your fanbase and set yourself up for success.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/11-07-making-it-look-easy", "title": "Making It Look Easy", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/11-07-making-it-look-easy", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’ve recently heard someone say that you need to make sure that people know you are doing hard work.</p><p>The thought is that you won’t be appreciated for what people don’t see.

I have no problem not saying goodbye when leaving a party or ignoring the fact that it is a person’s birthday when I see them rather than wishing them a happy birthday. This applies to social media as well, where I have no problem ignoring a request to like a page or an event. My reasoning is that I want my likes to be pure (which, now that I am typing this, also means they are more valuable) and by pure I mean that I genuinely like the things I like.</p><p>I think I’m in the minority. I don’t think most people think twice about being asked to like something. I think that most people will do so out of social obligation even if they feel ambivalent about or dislike the thing. That leads me to the question “what is the value of a socially obligated like?”</p><p>I do believe there is some potential value. For instance, when a local high school football player is going door-to-door selling something to raise money for the team and stops at my house, I feel a social obligation to give money (which is kind of strange, given the examples of times I don’t feel socially obligated that I listed above.) I’ll buy something from that kid if that something is in the $10-$20 range.

I’m not sure the best way to describe it, but I think I attacked them like a human would rather than like a computer could. I’ll give an example.</p><p>A common problem I’ve come across is tracking time. Let’s say I make an application that tracks how long I’ve been working on a particular task. If I try to solve this problem like a human could, I’d try to count the number of seconds I’ve been doing something. Each time the clock ticks, I increment a variable that is tracking my total time. And really, this isn’t an unreasonable approach to the problem, even for a computer. But solving the problem like a computer can is much better.</p><p>A computer can store abstract values that are difficult for the human mind to remember. And a computer can perform calculations on those values so much faster than I can blink that it boggles my mind if I let myself think about it. So a computer can use a different approach to solving this problem — it can store the starting time and the ending time and perform a calculation to find the total time. Why is this much better?</p><p>First, we have much richer information. Not only do we know the total time, but we know the start time and finish time. If we want to run a report and see how many hours are logged starting between 10 and 11 in the morning, we can. Since we can never predict how we may need to use information in the future, richer information is valuable.</p><p>Second, the system is more reliable. If our program is counting and runs into a crashing bug then the count is lost. That is really bad if you’re trying to track billable time. If we save a start date and the program crashes, we still have that start date available when the program starts back up and we can continue where we left off.</p><p>Third, the second approach is more efficient. If the computer constantly has to increment a number then it has to repeatedly work at regular intervals. That means it is using more power, and in the case of a mobile device draining the battery more quickly.</p><p>Since I’ve been doing programming for a while, the second approach is the only obvious one to me now. I have to work to try to remember how I approached the problem back when I was a beginner to see any other way to solve it.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/11-16-everything-is-getting-worse", "title": "Everything Is Getting Worse", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/11-16-everything-is-getting-worse", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Everything is always getting worse and everything is always getting better and we have little control over either.

Instead of reading an entire article right when we happened upon it, we could save it to read later.</p><p>The new freelance economy combined with teams spread across the world is introducing the time shifting of work. When I get my work done matters much less if you are in a time zone 12 hours behind. That opens up flexibility.

Physical copies of books and music albums aren’t laying around waiting for a curious youngster. I’m not too worried about the ramifications of that in particular because I believe we can actively share the things we know of, the great books and songs, which will result in an even stronger bond than a child coming across old music their parents like. I can share The Beatles with my daughter and at “hey I like this and I think you will too.”</p><p>But the article did make me think about what I am leaving behind. While digital artifacts can be harder to happen upon accidentally, they provide a much better way to transfer information. Like this blog. If I continue to write a blog post every day then I’ll have years of content to provide my daughter.

Could you say someone is a technology expert? So much technology exists and so much innovation is occurring that no one person can know technology authoritatively.

Each of them interrupted my workflow and made me think about tracking time instead of doing work. Each time I recorded time I’d get a little bit angry. Plus, tracking time actually made me work less because I wouldn’t work if I couldn’t record a meaningful amount of time.</p><p>Over the last few months I’ve found something that works for me. When I start on something new, I post the name of the project, plus any details I may need to remember about it, in a <a href='https://slack.com' title='Slack'>Slack</a> channel. Slack puts a time stamp on it so I know when I started. When I move to the next task or project, I’ll post the name of that activity in the channel. Slack puts in another time stamp on the next post and simply by subtracting the first time from the second my time is tracked. If I am taking a break, I’ll post a “-”. This posting process is frictionless and lets me concentrate on working.</p><p>The only downside to this workflow is that I haven’t eliminated the mental processing of the time — I’ve just moved that effort from the start to the end. That gets painful when I haven’t transferred my time out of Slack into our company time tracking system for two full weeks, but I highly recommend this method of tracking time.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/12-09-what-makes-you-angry", "title": "What Makes You Angry", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/12-09-what-makes-you-angry", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’ve always heard that anger is a secondary emotion.

I think the job for a certification, whether it be from a specific training or test, or college curriculum completion in the form of a diploma, is to establish trust. This trust is meant to be based upon past accomplishments and is expected to be established immediately, bypassing the years of relationship building that is necessary to organically build trust between people.</p><p>I believe that certificates do not work for their intended purpose. A certificate cannot reliably tell me the things I need to know to trust a person: whether she is reliable, smart, hardworking, and trustworthy. And I need to reiterate that I’d include many things as certificates that you may not immediately consider. College diplomas, technical certifications, professional licenses, and everything else that has a system in place to judge a person and determine whether to give her a piece of paper. They just don’t do their job — to the point where I will trust a person less if they have a certification.</p><p>I think that I’m a leading indicator. By that I mean that most people still value certifications at this point but I see the trend heading toward distrust. If that is true, what will be next? How do we gain someone’s trust? Will we be going back to a system where we earn it over years? Probably not. I think it will be by showing what you’ve done, at least in my line of work. Projects you’ve completed, problems you’ve solved, and things you’ve shipped on your own.

Instead we have to find our peace in each moment. Notice the ways that life and our emotions and internal dialog are pulling us. Acknowledge them — say to yourself “this is what struggle feels like”. Then enjoy it. Let it wash over you. Soon this thought and feeling will be gone, replaced by another.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/12-27-discipline-to-do-the-little-things-right", "title": "Discipline To Do The Little Things Right", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/12-27-discipline-to-do-the-little-things-right", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>While watching a Cowboys game a few weeks back we saw a play that just about defined the Cowboy’s season. It was during a punt, we were the kicking team, and the receiver didn’t catch the ball despite signaling for a fair catch. The ball was up for grabs by whichever team got to it first. It rolled around on the ground for a little bit and the receiver that dropped it was able to recover it. We didn’t even get close enough to fight for it.</p><p>We didn’t get close enough because our players weren’t running full speed. They assumed the ball would be caught and there was no point in putting in the effort to keep running. They couldn’t be bothered to push themselves to do things the right way. That little thing could easily lead to more points on the board.</p><p>That’s how the discipline to do the little things right pays off. It doesn’t create the lucky situation where the ball is dropped, but it does put you in a position to benefit from it.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/12-28-upper-limits-of-ability", "title": "Upper Limits Of Ability", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/12-28-upper-limits-of-ability", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>Every few months I’ll pick up one of my side projects again — apps that I’ve been working on for years.

I can’t remember if it was Thanksgiving day itself or the day after, but we wanted coffee. The place we were staying didn’t have a coffee maker so we had to go out but most places were closed.</p><p>We ended up walking about 10 to 15 minutes to Ritual Coffee because they were one of the few shops that was open. They had a line out the door. But the reason I’m sharing this story happened after we’d been waiting in that line for another 10 to 15 minutes. We’d made it inside the shop and I was able to witness the epitome of taking your time. The barista did not seem to care the line was out the door. He didn’t care that people were waiting and irritated. He slowly measured the espresso, carefully tamped it down and gently spun the tamper, and he made sure he was making the best cup of coffee he could.</p><p>That memory is at least a few years old but it had an impact on me. It is what I think of when I feel like I need to slow down and make the best thing I can.</p></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n  \n  \n  \n</main>\n\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n    <script>hljs.highlightAll();</script>\n  </body>\n</html>", "summary": "", "date_published": "2017-01-20T23:59:59-06:00"},{"id":"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/12-30-sustaining-the-status-quo", "title": "Sustaining The Status Quo", "url": "https://davidbrunow.github.io/brunow.org/documentation/brunow/12-30-sustaining-the-status-quo", "content_html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover\" />\n    \n    <link rel=\"icon\"       href=\"../../favicon.ico\" />\n    <link rel=\"mask-icon\"  href=\"../../favicon.svg\" color=\"#333333\" />\n    <link rel='stylesheet' href='../../css/site.css' />\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/styles/default.min.css\" />\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.0.1/highlight.min.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"app\">\n      <div class=\"doc-topic\">\n        \n\n<main id=\"main\" role=\"main\" class=\"main\">\n  <div class=\"container content-grid\">\n  <!-- The sidebar once we have one: <div class=\"summary\"></div> -->\n  \n  <div class=\"primary-content\">\n    <div class='content'><p>I’ve got a feeling in me that I want to communicate but I fear I’ll fail. I’ll try anyway.</p><p>I was watching some of Tupac’s music videos and listening to his powerful lyrics. His words express pain and frustration at living in a society that doesn’t care about him or people like him. Lyrics like “instead of a war on poverty, they’ve got a war on drugs so the police can bother me.”</p><p>I believe that Tupac is still remembered today and is considered one of the best rappers ever because he did things differently. He used lyrics to tell a story rather than only rap about girls and guns (although he did that some too.) Those songs — those beats and those lyrics — stir something inside me that wants to make the world different, better.</p><p>If you want to drive change you must do it by being different. Even that alone isn’t enough, you also need relentless effort.</p><p>But doing things the same way you always have or the same ways that the people in power do can only reinforce the current system. It will help to sustain the status quo and rather than tearing down the system you detest you will build it up.</p><p>It seems too simple.
