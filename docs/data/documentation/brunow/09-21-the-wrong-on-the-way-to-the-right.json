I see this in my daughter’s therapists. Some of them would rather my daughter not do something at all than to do it with improper form. It makes sense that they’d have this attitude because it is what they’ve been taught. They’ve been taught their mechanics and exercises and they’ve gotten a certification in those things. If they leave those behind in the name of adapting then they’ve left their realm of knowledge. Their work is less about helping other than it is reciting what they know."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I don’t agree with that way of doing things.
