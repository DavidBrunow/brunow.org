And because we always have a camera with us and it costs us nothing to take as many pictures as we’d like, it is so easy to find those right circumstances.

She knows how to position her subjects so the lighting is right or how to control the aperture to brighten the picture some. She has the tools on hand — a tripod and extra lighting — that allow her to make the imperfect situation work. If she’s good she’ll get inspiration from that imperfection and her work will be even better."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"I am not a professional photographer.
