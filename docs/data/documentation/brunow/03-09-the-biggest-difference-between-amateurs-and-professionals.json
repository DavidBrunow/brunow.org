She knows how to position her subjects so the lighting is right or how to control the aperture to brighten the picture some. She has the tools on hand — a tripod and extra lighting — that allow her to make the imperfect situation work. If she’s good she’ll get inspiration from that imperfection and her work will be even better."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I am not a professional photographer.
