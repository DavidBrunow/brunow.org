Now many more people have an amazing camera in their pocket with a 4 inch viewfinder so they know exactly what they’re taking a picture of and no requirement to handle the pictures carefully or take them to someone else before you can have them. Amazing things will come out of this as photography is brought to everyone.","type":"text"}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Not too long ago the only way other people would read your writing was when you wrote a book or got published in a magazine or journal.
