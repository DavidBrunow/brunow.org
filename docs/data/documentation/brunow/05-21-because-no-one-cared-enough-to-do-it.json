I’ll identify a problem I have that I can solve fairly simply.

I knew that going into making the Dharma Talks app because I volunteered to build it for a non-profit. But I’ve had other projects where I hadn’t realized the truth of this situation and put in time and energy with no direct monetary payback. I’m OK with that sometimes, but you may not be."}]}]}],"kind":"article","references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"kind":"article","type":"topic","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"All posts"}],"title":"Archive","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","role":"collectionGroup"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"title":"2016","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016","role":"collectionGroup","abstract":[],"type":"topic","kind":"article"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
