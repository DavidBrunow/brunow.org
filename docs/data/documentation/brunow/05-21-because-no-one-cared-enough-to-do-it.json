I’ll identify a problem I have that I can solve fairly simply.

It is a simple app but no one cared enough to make it."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Another way of phrases that statement is that no one had a sufficient incentive to build that app. Which brings us to the fundamental problem when you are in this situation — you probably can’t make money off of your idea. I knew that going into making the Dharma Talks app because I volunteered to build it for a non-profit. But I’ve had other projects where I hadn’t realized the truth of this situation and put in time and energy with no direct monetary payback. I’m OK with that sometimes, but you may not be.","type":"text"}]}],"kind":"content"}],"sections":[],"identifier":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/05-21-because-no-one-cared-enough-to-do-it"},"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016","kind":"article","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016","abstract":[],"role":"collectionGroup","title":"2016","type":"topic"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"kind":"article","role":"collectionGroup","abstract":[{"text":"All posts","type":"text"}],"url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","type":"topic","title":"Archive","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","title":"Brunow","kind":"symbol","type":"topic","role":"collection","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
