I’ll identify a problem I have that I can solve fairly simply. For example, my Dharma Talks app that u created because listen to Mission Dharma’s Dharma Talks was difficult in a mobile web browser because it wouldn’t keep track of where I was in the talk between my morning and evening commutes. It is a simple app but no one cared enough to make it."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Another way of phrases that statement is that no one had a sufficient incentive to build that app. Which brings us to the fundamental problem when you are in this situation — you probably can’t make money off of your idea. I knew that going into making the Dharma Talks app because I volunteered to build it for a non-profit. But I’ve had other projects where I hadn’t realized the truth of this situation and put in time and energy with no direct monetary payback. I’m OK with that sometimes, but you may not be."}]}]}],"metadata":{"platforms":[{"name":"Brunow","introducedAt":"2017.01.20"}],"title":"Because No One Cared Enough To Do It","modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}],"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"}},"abstract":[{"text":"date: 2016-05-21T00:22:12-05:00","type":"text"}],"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/05-21-because-no-one-cared-enough-to-do-it"]}],"sections":[],"schemaVersion":{"major":0,"minor":3,"patch":0},"identifier":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/05-21-because-no-one-cared-enough-to-do-it"},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"kind":"article","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016","abstract":[],"role":"collectionGroup","title":"2016"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","title":"Archive","kind":"article","abstract":[{"text":"All posts","type":"text"}],"type":"topic","role":"collectionGroup"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","kind":"symbol","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","title":"Brunow","type":"topic","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
