It was erratic and kept showing up in different places each time I saw it — kind of like that whack-a-mole game. I doubted my abilities and felt like the entire thing I created was awful because of this one (crashing) flaw.

Trying something else, failing, trying something else, failing, researching, stepping away and thinking, trying something else, failing, researching, trying something else, making a little headway, trying something else, and so on. Enough of that and I figured out the problem and a way to reproduce it every time (thank you Apple developer tools). Figuring out the problem was the hard part but solving it was difficult also. The problem was in a piece of third party code that I’d found because I didn’t want to write it myself. I ended up starting all over on the trying something else, failing, trying something else, failing, researching, and stepping away and thinking cycle. I slowly made progress and got to where I needed to be. Hurdling over one doubt at a time."}]}]}],"kind":"article","topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","metadata":{"title":"Overcoming Doubt","color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"},"modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}],"platforms":[{"name":"Brunow","introducedAt":"2017.01.20"}]},"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/04-30-overcoming-doubt"]}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"title":"2016","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016","role":"collectionGroup","abstract":[],"type":"topic","kind":"article"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
