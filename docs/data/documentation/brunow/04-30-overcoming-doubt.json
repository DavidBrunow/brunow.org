It was erratic and kept showing up in different places each time I saw it — kind of like that whack-a-mole game. I doubted my abilities and felt like the entire thing I created was awful because of this one (crashing) flaw. I was overwhelmed and wanted to crawl in a hole and try to forget about everything."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Instead I just kept going. Trying something else, failing, trying something else, failing, researching, stepping away and thinking, trying something else, failing, researching, trying something else, making a little headway, trying something else, and so on. Enough of that and I figured out the problem and a way to reproduce it every time (thank you Apple developer tools). Figuring out the problem was the hard part but solving it was difficult also. The problem was in a piece of third party code that I’d found because I didn’t want to write it myself. I ended up starting all over on the trying something else, failing, trying something else, failing, researching, and stepping away and thinking cycle. I slowly made progress and got to where I needed to be. Hurdling over one doubt at a time.","type":"text"}]}],"kind":"content"}],"schemaVersion":{"minor":3,"patch":0,"major":0},"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"date: 2016-04-30T07:34:53-05:00"}],"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/04-30-overcoming-doubt","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"metadata":{"platforms":[{"name":"Brunow","introducedAt":"2017.01.20"}],"title":"Overcoming Doubt","modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}],"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"}},"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016"]]},"kind":"article","references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"title":"2016","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016","abstract":[],"role":"collectionGroup","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016","type":"topic","kind":"article"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"type":"topic","role":"collection","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
