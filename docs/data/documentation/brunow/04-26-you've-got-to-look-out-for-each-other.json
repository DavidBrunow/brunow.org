One day — let’s pretend it was the next day after my mom gave me the advice, you know, for dramatic effect — I stuck up for Laura and told the kid to stop. He got off his bike and got up in my face. Probably said something cliché like “what are you going to do about it?” So I threw my textbook at him, hitting him square in the chest.
