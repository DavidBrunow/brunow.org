Probably said something cliché like “what are you going to do about it?” So I threw my textbook at him, hitting him square in the chest. He left, and left her alone after that.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"That incident reinforced my mom’s advice and it has become a strong part of who I am.
