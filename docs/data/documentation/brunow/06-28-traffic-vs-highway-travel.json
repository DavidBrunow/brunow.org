Some others on the roads with you might be going to the same place, but the farther the distance the less likely that is.

They have no incentive to slow you down or cut you off because you achieving your goal has no effect on them achieving theirs."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"You can choose which life you want.
