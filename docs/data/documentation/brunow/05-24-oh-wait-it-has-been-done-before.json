I’ve gotten my hopes up about this amazing thing that I could do just to find out that someone else has beaten me to it.

You probably won’t add a lot of value by adding your take on a solution. You may look around and notice that all the other solutions aren’t very good and think you can do better and you probably can. But the problem is that the reason all the other solutions aren’t good is probably that there is little to no money in this area. No money means no motivation to improve your app which means crappy apps.","type":"text"}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"Can you add something that will give you different results?
