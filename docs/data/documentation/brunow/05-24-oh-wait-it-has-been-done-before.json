In that moment I ask myself the question “Why hasn’t this been done before?” In my opening post I gave a list of four possibilities and over the last several days I’ve talked through them. But from the beginning I forgot about the most likely possibility in my experience — that my idea has been done before and I just didn’t know about it.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"This one is a let down. I’ve gotten my hopes up about this amazing thing that I could do just to find out that someone else has beaten me to it.

You probably won’t add a lot of value by adding your take on a solution. You may look around and notice that all the other solutions aren’t very good and think you can do better and you probably can. But the problem is that the reason all the other solutions aren’t good is probably that there is little to no money in this area. No money means no motivation to improve your app which means crappy apps."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Can you add something that will give you different results?
