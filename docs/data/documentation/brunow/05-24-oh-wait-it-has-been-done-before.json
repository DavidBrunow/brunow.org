You may look around and notice that all the other solutions aren’t very good and think you can do better and you probably can.

No money means no motivation to improve your app which means crappy apps."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Can you add something that will give you different results?
