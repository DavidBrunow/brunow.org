A few months ago I underestimated a project by a factor of three — it took me three times longer than I expected.

That isn’t the only time I’ve gotten an estimate wrong, either — I know the pain of software estimates."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"But unfortunately they are the best we’ve got. From a software developer’s point of view it might make sense to discard estimates. We definitely don’t make estimates and timelines for our company’s internal projects.
