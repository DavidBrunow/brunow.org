The author is against software estimation, mostly because he doesn’t believe that it is accurate.

A few months ago I underestimated a project by a factor of three — it took me three times longer than I expected. And since our company’s philosophy is that our clients should know the most they are going to pay up front, we ate the time for that mistake. That isn’t the only time I’ve gotten an estimate wrong, either — I know the pain of software estimates.","type":"text"}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"But unfortunately they are the best we’ve got. From a software developer’s point of view it might make sense to discard estimates. We definitely don’t make estimates and timelines for our company’s internal projects.
