This doom will be brought about by content blockers stopping advertising revenues. I’m going to have to listen to the podcast again to make sure I heard his point correctly, but even if I didn’t I think there’s an interesting thought experiment in the idea (and I’m completely ignoring any thoughts about the web going away right now, but that is very interesting too.)"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"If advertisers stopped paying to advertise on the web, where would they choose to advertise instead.
