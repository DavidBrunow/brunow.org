I do it all the time. I take it to a bad place at times — asking myself multiple times while completing a single task whether it is what I should be working on. Or I’ll take things to heart and really question myself when someone strikes out at me in a mean way. I question my intentions when I want to do things and ask myself why I did the things I’ve done."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Overall I believe that over-questioning is better than under-questioning.
