Unless the client and service provider have a strong relationship, the client doesn’t know if the service provider is recommending things for their own benefit or for the benefit of the client. They don’t know if the service provider is dragging their feet to rack up more hours. As a relationship is built these problems tend to fade but that takes time and consistency on both sides — the same people need to be working together because that trust isn’t easily transferable.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I feel like hourly billing is a necessary evil.
