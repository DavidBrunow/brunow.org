Unless the client and service provider have a strong relationship, the client doesn’t know if the service provider is recommending things for their own benefit or for the benefit of the client.

As a relationship is built these problems tend to fade but that takes time and consistency on both sides — the same people need to be working together because that trust isn’t easily transferable.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"I feel like hourly billing is a necessary evil.
