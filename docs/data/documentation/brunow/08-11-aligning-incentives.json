This is surprisingly difficult due to the complexities of work, the inherent vagueness of projects, and the need to get paid enough to survive. That is one reason why it is so important to work with great people — the care they put into their work bridges the gap between incentives.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"So let’s talk about the incentives with different types of pricing and I am going to specifically talk about pricing in the business to business service industry.

The service provider’s incentive is to charge for as many hours as possible to increase their income.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"This imbalance of incentives leads to tension and possibly distrust. Unless the client and service provider have a strong relationship, the client doesn’t know if the service provider is recommending things for their own benefit or for the benefit of the client. They don’t know if the service provider is dragging their feet to rack up more hours. As a relationship is built these problems tend to fade but that takes time and consistency on both sides — the same people need to be working together because that trust isn’t easily transferable."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I feel like hourly billing is a necessary evil.
