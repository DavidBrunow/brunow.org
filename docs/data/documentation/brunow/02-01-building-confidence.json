When I was young I was shy and timid and nothing changed much as I grew up. I was different enough from the other kids in elementary school that I got made fun of and bullied. My lack of confidence probably reached a peak my junior year of high school when I didn’t say more than a few sentences to my peers the entire year."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Today I’m very confident.
