When I was young I was shy and timid and nothing changed much as I grew up. I was different enough from the other kids in elementary school that I got made fun of and bullied. My lack of confidence probably reached a peak my junior year of high school when I didn’t say more than a few sentences to my peers the entire year."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Today I’m very confident. I strongly believe I can do anything I put my mind to doing. I believe I owe my confidence to taking on challenges that tested my faith in myself and overcoming them.

When I hit trouble on a project a voice in the back of my head starts calling me names. Stupid, incompetent, a fraud, in way over my head. That’s my fear talking and it is a great sign that I’m challenging myself the right amount."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"That fear can be enough to break your will and make you stop and declare failure.
