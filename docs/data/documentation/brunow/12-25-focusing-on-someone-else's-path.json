Getting it right means that you get to maintain as much of your speed as possible and also that you don’t fly off the track. Getting it wrong means a best case scenario of losing speed and a worse case scenario of losing control and running into something. The right path is dependent upon the car you are driving — how well its brakes work, the tires grip, and how heavy it is.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Due to how our brain works, we drive to where our eyes are looking.
