And when I hear someone saying the same thing about a topic as I’ve heard elsewhere I don’t question their originality — instead I add their voice to any others I’ve heard with a similar viewpoint. What I don’t do is turn off a podcast saying “I’ve already heard this before.”"}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I’m saying this as much to myself as I am to you — share your ideas and opinions, even if you feel they are unoriginal."}],"type":"paragraph"}]}],"sections":[],"kind":"article","schemaVersion":{"major":0,"minor":3,"patch":0},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"abstract":[],"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016","title":"2016","type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016","role":"collectionGroup","kind":"article"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"role":"collection","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","title":"Brunow","type":"topic","kind":"symbol","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
