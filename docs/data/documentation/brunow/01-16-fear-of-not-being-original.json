I’ve noticed that I don’t need novelty to find a topic interesting. What matters more is that it is a topic I’m interested in. And when I hear someone saying the same thing about a topic as I’ve heard elsewhere I don’t question their originality — instead I add their voice to any others I’ve heard with a similar viewpoint. What I don’t do is turn off a podcast saying “I’ve already heard this before.”"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"I’m saying this as much to myself as I am to you — share your ideas and opinions, even if you feel they are unoriginal.","type":"text"}]}],"kind":"content"}],"variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/01-16-fear-of-not-being-original"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"metadata":{"platforms":[{"introducedAt":"2017.01.20","name":"Brunow"}],"title":"Fear Of Not Being Original","modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}],"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"}},"kind":"article","sections":[],"abstract":[{"text":"date: 2016-01-16T06:21:32-06:00","type":"text"}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","kind":"symbol","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","type":"topic","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
