And when I hear someone saying the same thing about a topic as I’ve heard elsewhere I don’t question their originality — instead I add their voice to any others I’ve heard with a similar viewpoint. What I don’t do is turn off a podcast saying “I’ve already heard this before.”","type":"text"}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"I’m saying this as much to myself as I am to you — share your ideas and opinions, even if you feel they are unoriginal.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"}],"kind":"content"}],"kind":"article","hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016"]]},"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"date: 2016-01-16T06:21:32-06:00"}],"metadata":{"title":"Fear Of Not Being Original","platforms":[{"introducedAt":"2017.01.20","name":"Brunow"}],"modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}],"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"}},"sections":[],"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/01-16-fear-of-not-being-original"]}],"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/01-16-fear-of-not-being-original","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"role":"collectionGroup","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016","abstract":[],"kind":"article","title":"2016","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016","type":"topic"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","title":"Brunow","role":"collection","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
