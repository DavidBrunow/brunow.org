And when I hear someone saying the same thing about a topic as I’ve heard elsewhere I don’t question their originality — instead I add their voice to any others I’ve heard with a similar viewpoint. What I don’t do is turn off a podcast saying “I’ve already heard this before.”","type":"text"}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"I’m saying this as much to myself as I am to you — share your ideas and opinions, even if you feel they are unoriginal.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"}],"kind":"content"}],"sections":[],"metadata":{"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"},"platforms":[{"introducedAt":"2017.01.20","name":"Brunow"}],"title":"Fear Of Not Being Original","modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}]},"schemaVersion":{"patch":0,"minor":3,"major":0},"variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/01-16-fear-of-not-being-original"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"type":"topic","role":"collectionGroup","kind":"article","title":"2016","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016","abstract":[]},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"title":"Brunow","kind":"symbol","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
