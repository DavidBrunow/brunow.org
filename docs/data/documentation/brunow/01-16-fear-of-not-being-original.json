I’ve noticed that I don’t need novelty to find a topic interesting. What matters more is that it is a topic I’m interested in. And when I hear someone saying the same thing about a topic as I’ve heard elsewhere I don’t question their originality — instead I add their voice to any others I’ve heard with a similar viewpoint. What I don’t do is turn off a podcast saying “I’ve already heard this before.”","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"I’m saying this as much to myself as I am to you — share your ideas and opinions, even if you feel they are unoriginal.","type":"text"}]}]}],"abstract":[{"text":"date: 2016-01-16T06:21:32-06:00","type":"text"}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"title":"2016","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016","role":"collectionGroup","abstract":[],"type":"topic","kind":"article"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
