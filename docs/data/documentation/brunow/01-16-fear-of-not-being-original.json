I’ve noticed that I don’t need novelty to find a topic interesting. What matters more is that it is a topic I’m interested in. And when I hear someone saying the same thing about a topic as I’ve heard elsewhere I don’t question their originality — instead I add their voice to any others I’ve heard with a similar viewpoint. What I don’t do is turn off a podcast saying “I’ve already heard this before.”","type":"text"}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I’m saying this as much to myself as I am to you — share your ideas and opinions, even if you feel they are unoriginal."}],"type":"paragraph"}]}],"metadata":{"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"},"modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}],"platforms":[{"introducedAt":"2017.01.20","name":"Brunow"}],"title":"Fear Of Not Being Original"},"kind":"article","variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/01-16-fear-of-not-being-original"]}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"kind":"article","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","title":"Archive","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"All posts"}],"type":"topic","role":"collectionGroup"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","kind":"symbol","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
