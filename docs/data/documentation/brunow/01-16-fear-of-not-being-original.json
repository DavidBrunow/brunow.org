I’ve noticed that I don’t need novelty to find a topic interesting. What matters more is that it is a topic I’m interested in. And when I hear someone saying the same thing about a topic as I’ve heard elsewhere I don’t question their originality — instead I add their voice to any others I’ve heard with a similar viewpoint. What I don’t do is turn off a podcast saying “I’ve already heard this before.”","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I’m saying this as much to myself as I am to you — share your ideas and opinions, even if you feel they are unoriginal."}]}],"kind":"content"}],"variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/01-16-fear-of-not-being-original"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/01-16-fear-of-not-being-original","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"title":"Archive","role":"collectionGroup","abstract":[{"text":"All posts","type":"text"}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","kind":"article","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","type":"topic"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"title":"Brunow","kind":"symbol","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
