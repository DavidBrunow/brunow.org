I can see where data about my shopping habits at a retail store could belong to that store and maybe similarly for an online store. But where does their data end and mine begin? Is it when the data is about my health and the things I own? As we move internet connectivity into more parts of our home we’re likely to see manufacturers try to collect more and more data about how we interact with their products. To pick a silly example, does the company that sold me a toaster have any right to the information about how much toast I each? I don’t think it does.","type":"text"}]}]}],"schemaVersion":{"minor":3,"patch":0,"major":0},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","kind":"article","title":"Archive","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"All posts"}],"role":"collectionGroup","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"role":"collection","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
