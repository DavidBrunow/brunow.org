I remember earlier in my career when I would agonize over the process. I think the biggest difference today is that I have a lot more experience and therefore more to say. I was able to say that I’ve started my own company, that I’m a member of Denton’s tech community, and that I’m teaching iOS. I had a story to tell because I’ve lived a story."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Part of the reason that I can tell a story is that I’m in my mid-30s and I’ve lived much more life than I had a decade ago.
