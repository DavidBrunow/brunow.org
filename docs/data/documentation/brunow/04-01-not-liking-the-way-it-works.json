I can see how that makes perfect, rational sense — it’s an obvious competitive advantage — but that’s not what I want. I want a company name that means something to me and that will hopefully mean something to my customers. I want something that shows that we are unique and not a commodity."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Along those same lines, I don’t like the way that I see a lot of the business world work.
