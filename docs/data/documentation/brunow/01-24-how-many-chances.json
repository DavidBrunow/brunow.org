How many chances do you give her? Will you listen to her a second or third time? Most likely not. You subconsciously set her reputation as low and won’t give her another chance. She’s coming into your brand new relationship with her hand out asking for something. And she’s building that relationship on an unstable foundation with no trust.

A person comes up to you at a coffee shop and tries to sell you on something. If you are honest with yourself, do you even listen to what she has to say?

I doubt it would be many, if any, more than the first person."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"If you have a perfect sales pitch with a 100% success rate then either of these strategies will work.
