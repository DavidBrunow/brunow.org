If you aren’t familiar with A\/B testing, the general concept is that each visitor will be shown a different version of your site, an A version and a B version, randomly but in equal proportions over the same period of time. So for example, over the next week half the visitors to my site will see a version A with a big green button for proceeding to the next step and the other half will see a big orange version for proceeding to the next step. The point of the tool is to see whether A or B is the better design based upon what percentage of users get to the next step for each.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"The Google presenter describing this tool talked about how difficult it is to know whether a design is truly good just by looking at it.

Why does design A work better than design B? If you can’t find out why then you can’t add anything to your stockpile of design wisdom. Once you can find out why then you can iterate off of that reason to find an entirely new set of designs. You can use that data point to spark creativity rather than inadvertently stifling it.","type":"text"}]}],"kind":"content"}],"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/02-16-collecting-and-analyzing-data-as-a-tool-for-learning","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2015":{"title":"2015","type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2015","role":"collectionGroup","abstract":[],"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2015","kind":"article"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"kind":"article","title":"Archive","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","type":"topic","abstract":[{"text":"All posts","type":"text"}],"role":"collectionGroup","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"title":"Brunow","type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","role":"collection","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
