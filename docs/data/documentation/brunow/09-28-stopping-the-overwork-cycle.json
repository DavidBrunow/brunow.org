Last week I hit the sickness part of the cycle at the perfect time. I was taking a couple of days off work for a conference which meant that I didn’t try to power through getting work done while sick. The conference was intended as inspiration for creatives and I was still able to watch much of it through a live stream. I heard things I’ve heard before and always said “that’s a good idea” but never really took action on. I would always bow to the “realities” of life — that sounds fine for that guy, but he doesn’t have things going on like I do. I’ve got bills to pay and roofs to put over heads and student loans to pay."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"During that sickness and resting period I read the quote above and I felt that it was describing this part of my life. I keep going through this cycle because I keep running away from this problem. I keep looking at everyone else around me as the problem when the problem is me. The problem is how I handle overwork and saying no. I want to do everything — and rightly so, there are millions of amazing things to do — but I cannot do so without hurting myself and making myself miserable. I have limits, I am not Superman. The world will always ask more of me as it does of all talented people. I have to handle that."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"So I’m changing my attitude.

Meetings and commuting and that sort of things can bend.
