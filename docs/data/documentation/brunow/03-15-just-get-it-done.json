I see many techy people that want to explain how difficult something is, the risks involved, and how that something is out of scope from the rest of the project. That’s all important but if your goal is to ship a high quality product that reflects well upon you, which is my goal, then they don’t matter. If your goal is to make money then the “out of scope” part my be necessary but I’d argue not.
