With a daily running routine this difficulty may come in the form of thoughts in your head telling you that you aren’t making progress after just a week of running. With a training program you may start to believe that you just can’t learn what you’re trying to learn because it doesn’t feel like you’ve made any progress.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"The time it takes to see your outcomes feels like forever when you’re in the middle of it.

They are convinced that what they wanted at the beginning isn’t possible. They won’t ever get into better shape by running.

They close down their new business because it isn’t ever going to take off.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Another group of people handles those thoughts differently but nearly as destructively. When she doesn’t see progress from running in a week, she changes her exercise program to lifting weights instead. And then a week later changes it to something else. She feels she has better control over the outcome. When he doesn’t feel like he’s learned anything in a week he tries something else, something closer to his areas of expertise. When the new business isn’t attracting customers they decide to go after a different group of customers. This group is just as likely to succeed as the first group."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"The hardest part about doing just about anything is sticking to it.
