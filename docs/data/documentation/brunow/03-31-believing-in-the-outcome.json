With a daily running routine this difficulty may come in the form of thoughts in your head telling you that you aren’t making progress after just a week of running. With a training program you may start to believe that you just can’t learn what you’re trying to learn because it doesn’t feel like you’ve made any progress."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"The time it takes to see your outcomes feels like forever when you’re in the middle of it.
