You will simply be a cog in someone else’s machine because you won’t know how to use your talent. But with vision your talents are amplified. One of my greatest strengths is that my vision for how I want things to be drives me to learn new things and overcome challenges simply to see my vision come to life. What I know is amplified by the drive towards my vision and nothing can stop me."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"So what do you do if you don’t have vision?
