I can’t remember the exact selling points that made me want it so badly but I think it had to do with multitasking or a better user interface. Who knows now."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I finally bought OS\/2 and I was so excited.

My point is that if you are creating technology then you need to show people what they can do with it. You’ll easily seduce geeks with specs and smooth, chamfered aluminum, but most people just don’t care. They care about how it will fit into their life and make their life better. They care about how difficult it will be to switch from what they have already have and will most likely not see why the change is worth that pain."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"So make sure you can show people how they can use your thing or directly benefit from it.
