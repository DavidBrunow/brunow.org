That’s what smart people do every day. But I think it gets applied too broadly. Some things can’t be figured out. The next successful thing seems like something that a smart person could figure out. But they can’t.

Confusing what you know and believe for how the world is."}]}]}],"metadata":{"title":"Knowing What Success Looks Like","platforms":[{"name":"Brunow","introducedAt":"2017.01.20"}],"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"},"modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}]},"schemaVersion":{"major":0,"patch":0,"minor":3},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","title":"Brunow","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
