If you spend the first hour of every day with a purpose and bettering yourself then those actions will spill over into the rest of your day. If you have a morning routine that you look forward to in the mornings then you will excitedly get out of bed instead of laying there as long as you can convince yourself to."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I’m not sure if I can recommend the book yet because it feels awfully “self-helpy” with all of the marks of that genre — promising everyone that with just one little secret they can get rich and be in shape, etc."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"But I really like the ideas from the book that I’ve shared here and I’m going to continue to experiment with them.
