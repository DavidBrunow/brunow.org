We know the outcome we want and we believe we have the power to create that outcome. We want every blade of grass evenly cut.

We put lights anywhere it is dark and a smooth surface anywhere it is rough. Irregularity and the unknown are bad."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Some things we know we can’t control.
