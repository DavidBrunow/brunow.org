We know the outcome we want and we believe we have the power to create that outcome. We want every blade of grass evenly cut. We want our kids to be an age appropriate height, weight, and learning level. We keep our houses at the perfect, comfortable temperature and we kid proof and stain proof every surface. We put lights anywhere it is dark and a smooth surface anywhere it is rough. Irregularity and the unknown are bad.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Some things we know we can’t control.
