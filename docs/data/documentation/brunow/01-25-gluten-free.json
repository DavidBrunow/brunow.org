Excursions outside the base were troubling because they got me out of my routine."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Routine is critical with a gastronomical issue.

It’s a combination of fear, a sense of brokenness and that your body is letting you down. And it’s a secret you can’t share with the world because it’s so embarrassing, especially when you have no idea why it happens.

Ugh, that’s gotta be a tough job for them.

But that wasn’t a direct correlation either, I still got sick when I felt stress free."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"So yeah, complex machine.

That is a tough thing to do here in North Texas, and it made me feel somewhat un-American. But the results were undeniable. I cannot describe what a joy it is to have a solid bowel movement (and how difficult it is to refrain from sharing the good news with those close to me to avoid grossing them out). After the initial positive results I gave up pretty much anything with wheat in it, the hardest of which was beer. In addition to feeling un-American I felt un-manly, but damn it’s worth it. I experienced an amazing side effect that I never would have expected — years of constant head congestion just went away. Studies show links between food and outdoor allergies, so I assume that was the mechanism.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Fortunately, around the same time that I went gluten free it became a diet trend and it is getting easier and easier to avoid it.
