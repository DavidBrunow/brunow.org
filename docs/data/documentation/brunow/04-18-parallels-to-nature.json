The problem is finding the right parallel. For example, I was thinking about the success of Facebook. I don’t believe that Facebook is successful because it solved any technological problem in a better or unique way. I believe it was at the right place at the right time -\/m- that the conditions were right for it to succeed and grow. I’m not trying to minimize their accomplishments because a lot of hard work and serious skills went into it, but in a sea of undifferentiated social networks something was different for Facebook.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"A couple of days ago I was thinking about potential natural analogies.
