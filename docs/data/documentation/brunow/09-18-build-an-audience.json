We each take a bunch of different ideas and concepts and form them together into what we hope is a unified whole. Many times we fail at this, as authors do, and what we make feels like a jumbled mess. The big difference between us and authors is that they can use all of their given language while we can only use the subset that is our programming language."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Of course the book industry is in decline and may not be able to be saved in the way we know it.
