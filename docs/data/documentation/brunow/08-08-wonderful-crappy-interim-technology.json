Due to the powers that control the TV industry, access to their content has been limited to how they want to give it to you, rather than how you want to get it. DVRs eased this pain a little by giving you control over some of how you get it, within limitations.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"But DVRs are an interim solution. Having the content you want to watch available when you want it is viewers’ end goal and we are getting close to that happening. At that point, an interim technology like DVRs will just be crappy.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Look at what you’re building — is it an interim technology or the end goal?
