Sometimes that makes our irrational human brains not even try to solve the problem or come up with zany numbers to try to make things work. Figuring out the scale of a problem or situation is hard but the most important part of predicting where things will go.

I tend to round down in my projections because I feel it is safer to do so. But that also means that I could miss out on opportunities because I underestimate their value.
