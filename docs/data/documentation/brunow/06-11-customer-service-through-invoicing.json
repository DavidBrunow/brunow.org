Usually you’ll have people that will either bill everything by the hour and put more of the risk of anything not going to plan on the client, or you’ll have people that will bill everything at a fixed price which puts more risk on their shoulders but also some benefit if they can continually outperform their estimates.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"I do it differently.

I’m taking on all the risk myself.","type":"text"}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"I do this because I see invoicing as something more than a way to receive money.
