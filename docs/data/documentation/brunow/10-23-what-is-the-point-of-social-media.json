People can easily share what is important to them which might resonate with a large population and get shared even more.

The more you share, the more doors you open to allow others to figure out they like you."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"My goal is to share who I am, and for my business to share who we are and the cool things we make."}]}]}],"schemaVersion":{"major":0,"minor":3,"patch":0},"sections":[],"variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/10-23-what-is-the-point-of-social-media"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/10-23-what-is-the-point-of-social-media","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"date: 2015-10-23T22:45:03-05:00"}],"kind":"article","metadata":{"platforms":[{"name":"Brunow","introducedAt":"2017.01.20"}],"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"},"title":"What Is The Point Of Social Media","modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}]},"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2015"]]},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"role":"collection","title":"Brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
