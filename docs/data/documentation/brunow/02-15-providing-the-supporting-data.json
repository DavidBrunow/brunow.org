I think reasons two and three are OK. As I’ve written about before I believe it is valuable to share my opinions even if they are not fully formed. Sometimes I’ll just have to say “this is how I feel about it but I’m not exactly sure why.” And we all have to assume a certain level of tacit knowledge, although I think I’ll constantly be working on the right balance."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"But laziness isn’t a good excuse.
