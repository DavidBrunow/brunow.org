I left there about 4 years ago and yet one of the programs they were implementing while I was still there is still in place — in essence, it is a debit card rewards program. My initial thought was that they are treating a tactic as a strategy and lacking any real strategy. That may be true but seeing as how I’m not part of the day to day operations it would be arrogant of me to make that assumption. But I do think it is a fun exercise to think about if I remove it from this context and think about banking generically.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I don’t know much about the state of banking today. I have done no research on the subject in years and don’t really care. But I do know my own preferences, which I can use to define at least a small segment of the market. The question is whether that segment is a sign of things to come or just an anomaly. I’d argue that we’re on the cutting edge."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"In particular, my preferences are to do all of my banking online or through mobile apps.

My strategy depends on my worldview and the future I see through my biases. I could be wrong about any or all of my assumptions.
