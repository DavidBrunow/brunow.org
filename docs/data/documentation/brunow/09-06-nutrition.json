Digesting food, processing thoughts, and flexing muscles all use a chemical reaction to achieve their purpose. Knowing about proper nutrition is essential to a healthy life and therefore the concepts behind these chemical reactions have been simplified into 3 macronutrients and calorie counting.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"But this simplification doesn’t work. We are taught that each of these macronutrients is basically interchangeable — that a calorie is a calorie. But that isn’t true. The chemical reactions for different types of calories are different and therefore their outcomes will be different. Sugar intake is the start of a long chain reaction because it changes the chemical state of your body. So many factors are involved that it would be very difficult to know the exact impact."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"But I believe the real problem is figuring out ways to simplify knowledge without going too far. Maybe this is where wearable technologies can help out.
