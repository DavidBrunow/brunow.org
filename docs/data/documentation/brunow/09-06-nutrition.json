We are taught that each of these macronutrients is basically interchangeable — that a calorie is a calorie. But that isn’t true. The chemical reactions for different types of calories are different and therefore their outcomes will be different. Sugar intake is the start of a long chain reaction because it changes the chemical state of your body. So many factors are involved that it would be very difficult to know the exact impact.","type":"text"}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"But I believe the real problem is figuring out ways to simplify knowledge without going too far. Maybe this is where wearable technologies can help out.

Computers are great at taking data like the state of your digestive system, comparing it to other data like all the available foods on the plant, and providing an output."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"This belt would know when you’re low on potassium and recommend a banana.
