It was during a punt, we were the kicking team, and the receiver didn’t catch the ball despite signaling for a fair catch. The ball was up for grabs by whichever team got to it first. It rolled around on the ground for a little bit and the receiver that dropped it was able to recover it. We didn’t even get close enough to fight for it.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"We didn’t get close enough because our players weren’t running full speed.
