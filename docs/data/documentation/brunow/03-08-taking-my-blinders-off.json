I’m not letting the popular media work me up in a frenzy over silly epidemics and I’m not paying attention to Kim Kardashian’s latest who knows what. I don’t let mass media influence me very much because I carefully curate my media consumption. Mostly this is a good thing. It allows me to focus on what matters to me and avoid much of the unnecessary negativity of the world."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"But I also use it to escape the anger and sadness I feel when I know about situations that I don’t feel like I can change.

All these issues tear open my heart and so I shut them out of my life.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"But I don’t think that’s OK anymore.
