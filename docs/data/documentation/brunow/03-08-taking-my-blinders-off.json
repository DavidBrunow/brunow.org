I’m not letting the popular media work me up in a frenzy over silly epidemics and I’m not paying attention to Kim Kardashian’s latest who knows what. I don’t let mass media influence me very much because I carefully curate my media consumption. Mostly this is a good thing. It allows me to focus on what matters to me and avoid much of the unnecessary negativity of the world."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"But I also use it to escape the anger and sadness I feel when I know about situations that I don’t feel like I can change. Like Ferguson. Like the awful inequality that blacks face in our country. Like the biases our society has against women.

All these issues tear open my heart and so I shut them out of my life."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"But I don’t think that’s OK anymore.
