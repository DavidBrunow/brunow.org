You have to understand enough of the mechanics of the problem to be able to try a solution that is at least close to the right one. If you don’t understand those mechanics then the solution will be too far away to provide you any clues on how to get closer. You’ll be stuck far away from the solution. But at the same time, those trials could teach you more about the mechanics and move you closer to the solution."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"If you work through the full logical proof then you are spending a lot of time on things that the human mind isn’t very good at and that computers are very good at.
