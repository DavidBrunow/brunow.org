The important takeaway is that you should be thinking about those processes."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"level":2,"anchor":"Step-3-Enable-Collaboration","type":"heading","text":"Step 3 — Enable Collaboration"},{"type":"orderedList","items":[{"content":[{"inlineContent":[{"text":"Be able to integrate multiple changes seamlessly — This is critical to building quality software and to maintaining momentum. Without a good way to integrate changes, people will not merge their changes in a timely manner, changes will get lost, and you’ll find that the things you’ve already fixed are broken again. Not having that good way to integrate changes causes extra work and energy to be expended on tasks a computer should be doing, so your team will be spending time on that frustrating task rather than on the fun task of building cool new things. You’ll get less work done in the same amount of time and your team will be angrier.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"We use Git to make our change integrations simple."}]}]},{"content":[{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Make communication clear and open for everyone involved — The biggest hindrance to getting people to join in on a project is having to tell them all the background information about it.
