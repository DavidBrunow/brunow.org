For short term stress, like waiting for lab results after your daughter had a seizure or taking care of your significant other when he has a high fever, cutting out sleep is the right reaction. Our bodies secrete the right hormones and hold back the wrong ones and prepare us perfectly for that situation.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"The problem comes when our body responds the same way during long term stress. We sleep less and try to fix the situation more, for months or even years. The less sleep we get the less well we handle our sleep deprivation.

You can easily spend a half hour and have no idea what you thought about. But if you are intentionally sitting and trying to not think about anything then the thoughts that show up stand out more. And by the way, it is fine if those thoughts show up, that doesn’t mean you’re doing meditation wrong.
