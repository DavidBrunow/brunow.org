I picture it like this — everything I write is like a map at some level of zoom. If we are zoomed all the way into the city of Denton, Texas and describe everything in it then we will not be making a coherent point. What we write will be mostly boring. So we would zoom out a little on the map and just describe the essential things to make our point to describe the essence of Denton.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"But if we zoom into a detail about Denton — maybe the animal shelter — then there is a whole new coherent story to be told. At that level of detail we have to leave out the rest of the information about the city.
