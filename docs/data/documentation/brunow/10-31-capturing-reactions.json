Wearing a body camera is on potential option but it is unlikely you’ll get the exact shots you want. The new iPhones have a new feature that gets us closer.

The beautiful thing about it is that you’re prepping for one particular moment, unlike in a video which doesn’t have a similar short window, and so you capture much more meaningful moving images than you would with video."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I still think it could be better but I’m not quite sure how yet."}]}],"kind":"content"}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","abstract":[{"text":"All posts","type":"text"}],"kind":"article","type":"topic","role":"collectionGroup","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","title":"Archive"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2015":{"role":"collectionGroup","title":"2015","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2015","type":"topic","abstract":[],"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2015","kind":"article"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","kind":"symbol","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","type":"topic","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
