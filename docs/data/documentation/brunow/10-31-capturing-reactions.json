Wearing a body camera is on potential option but it is unlikely you’ll get the exact shots you want. The new iPhones have a new feature that gets us closer. It records a second and a half before and after a picture so I can take a picture while saying something to my daughter and get her entire reaction. The beautiful thing about it is that you’re prepping for one particular moment, unlike in a video which doesn’t have a similar short window, and so you capture much more meaningful moving images than you would with video."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"I still think it could be better but I’m not quite sure how yet.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"}],"kind":"content"}],"sections":[],"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2015"]]},"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/10-31-capturing-reactions","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/10-31-capturing-reactions"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"schemaVersion":{"major":0,"minor":3,"patch":0},"metadata":{"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"},"platforms":[{"name":"Brunow","introducedAt":"2017.01.20"}],"modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}],"title":"Capturing Reactions"},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"All posts"}],"kind":"article","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","role":"collectionGroup","title":"Archive","type":"topic"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2015":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2015","abstract":[],"kind":"article","title":"2015","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2015","role":"collectionGroup","type":"topic"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","title":"Brunow","role":"collection","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
