Wearing a body camera is on potential option but it is unlikely you’ll get the exact shots you want. The new iPhones have a new feature that gets us closer. It records a second and a half before and after a picture so I can take a picture while saying something to my daughter and get her entire reaction. The beautiful thing about it is that you’re prepping for one particular moment, unlike in a video which doesn’t have a similar short window, and so you capture much more meaningful moving images than you would with video.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"I still think it could be better but I’m not quite sure how yet.","type":"text"}]}],"kind":"content"}],"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2015"]]},"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/10-31-capturing-reactions"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"identifier":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/10-31-capturing-reactions"},"kind":"article","metadata":{"title":"Capturing Reactions","color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"},"platforms":[{"introducedAt":"2017.01.20","name":"Brunow"}],"modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}]},"schemaVersion":{"patch":0,"major":0,"minor":3},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"title":"Archive","type":"topic","role":"collectionGroup","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","kind":"article","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"All posts"}]},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2015":{"title":"2015","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2015","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2015","kind":"article","role":"collectionGroup","abstract":[],"type":"topic"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"role":"collection","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","title":"Brunow","type":"topic","kind":"symbol","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
