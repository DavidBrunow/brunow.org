Wearing a body camera is on potential option but it is unlikely you’ll get the exact shots you want. The new iPhones have a new feature that gets us closer. It records a second and a half before and after a picture so I can take a picture while saying something to my daughter and get her entire reaction. The beautiful thing about it is that you’re prepping for one particular moment, unlike in a video which doesn’t have a similar short window, and so you capture much more meaningful moving images than you would with video.","type":"text"}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"I still think it could be better but I’m not quite sure how yet.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"}]}],"kind":"article","variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/10-31-capturing-reactions"]}],"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2015"]]},"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"date: 2015-10-31T23:49:09-05:00"}],"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","schemaVersion":{"minor":3,"major":0,"patch":0},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"All posts"}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","kind":"article","type":"topic","title":"Archive","role":"collectionGroup","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2015":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2015","type":"topic","kind":"article","abstract":[],"role":"collectionGroup","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2015","title":"2015"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","kind":"symbol","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
