Wearing a body camera is on potential option but it is unlikely you’ll get the exact shots you want. The new iPhones have a new feature that gets us closer. It records a second and a half before and after a picture so I can take a picture while saying something to my daughter and get her entire reaction. The beautiful thing about it is that you’re prepping for one particular moment, unlike in a video which doesn’t have a similar short window, and so you capture much more meaningful moving images than you would with video."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"I still think it could be better but I’m not quite sure how yet.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"}]}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"kind":"article","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","title":"Archive","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"All posts"}],"type":"topic","role":"collectionGroup"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2015":{"kind":"article","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2015","abstract":[],"type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2015","role":"collectionGroup","title":"2015"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","kind":"symbol","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
