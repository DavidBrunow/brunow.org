Wearing a body camera is on potential option but it is unlikely you’ll get the exact shots you want. The new iPhones have a new feature that gets us closer. It records a second and a half before and after a picture so I can take a picture while saying something to my daughter and get her entire reaction. The beautiful thing about it is that you’re prepping for one particular moment, unlike in a video which doesn’t have a similar short window, and so you capture much more meaningful moving images than you would with video."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"I still think it could be better but I’m not quite sure how yet.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"}],"kind":"content"}],"schemaVersion":{"patch":0,"major":0,"minor":3},"identifier":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/10-31-capturing-reactions"},"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2015"]]},"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","metadata":{"platforms":[{"introducedAt":"2017.01.20","name":"Brunow"}],"title":"Capturing Reactions","color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"},"modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}]},"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"date: 2015-10-31T23:49:09-05:00"}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"type":"topic","kind":"article","role":"collectionGroup","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"All posts"}],"title":"Archive","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"type":"topic","role":"collection","title":"Brunow","kind":"symbol","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
