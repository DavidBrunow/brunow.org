Wearing a body camera is on potential option but it is unlikely you’ll get the exact shots you want. The new iPhones have a new feature that gets us closer. It records a second and a half before and after a picture so I can take a picture while saying something to my daughter and get her entire reaction. The beautiful thing about it is that you’re prepping for one particular moment, unlike in a video which doesn’t have a similar short window, and so you capture much more meaningful moving images than you would with video."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"I still think it could be better but I’m not quite sure how yet.","type":"text"}]}],"kind":"content"}],"kind":"article","identifier":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/10-31-capturing-reactions"},"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","metadata":{"title":"Capturing Reactions","modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}],"platforms":[{"introducedAt":"2017.01.20","name":"Brunow"}],"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"}},"variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/10-31-capturing-reactions"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2015":{"type":"topic","kind":"article","title":"2015","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2015","role":"collectionGroup","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2015","abstract":[]},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","title":"Archive","role":"collectionGroup","kind":"article","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","abstract":[{"text":"All posts","type":"text"}]},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","title":"Brunow","role":"collection","kind":"symbol","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
