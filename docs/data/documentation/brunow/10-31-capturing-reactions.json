Wearing a body camera is on potential option but it is unlikely you’ll get the exact shots you want. The new iPhones have a new feature that gets us closer. It records a second and a half before and after a picture so I can take a picture while saying something to my daughter and get her entire reaction. The beautiful thing about it is that you’re prepping for one particular moment, unlike in a video which doesn’t have a similar short window, and so you capture much more meaningful moving images than you would with video."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I still think it could be better but I’m not quite sure how yet."}]}]}],"schemaVersion":{"major":0,"minor":3,"patch":0},"sections":[],"variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/10-31-capturing-reactions"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/10-31-capturing-reactions","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"date: 2015-10-31T23:49:09-05:00"}],"kind":"article","metadata":{"platforms":[{"name":"Brunow","introducedAt":"2017.01.20"}],"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"},"title":"Capturing Reactions","modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}]},"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2015"]]},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"role":"collection","title":"Brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
