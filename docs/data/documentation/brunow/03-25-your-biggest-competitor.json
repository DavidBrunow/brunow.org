By that, I mean that people are not buying your product or service from anyone. For example, a household that does not buy any milk is a non-consumption household for a milk company. To combat non-consumption, milk companies team up in dairy industry associations and pay for advertising about the benefits of milk. This advertising is meant to convert non-milk-drinkers which increases the size of the industry. Every milk company benefits when their industry is larger.","type":"text"}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I believe that the idea of forming a team with other companies in your industry — your competition — is powerful.
