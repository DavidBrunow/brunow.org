For example, Horace Dediu recently discussed the British Navy and how its dominance led to every other country modeling their navy after Britain’s. He then compared this to the auto industry and emerging countries modeling their industry after that of America’s. I’m not doing his thoughts justice but I highly recommend all the episodes of his Asymcar podcast which I have linked below.
