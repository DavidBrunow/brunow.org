For example, Horace Dediu recently discussed the British Navy and how its dominance led to every other country modeling their navy after Britain’s. He then compared this to the auto industry and emerging countries modeling their industry after that of America’s. I’m not doing his thoughts justice but I highly recommend all the episodes of his Asymcar podcast which I have linked below. That particular discussion was in episode 21."}]},{"text":"Seth Godin","anchor":"Seth-Godin","level":3,"type":"heading"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Expertise: Marketing, business, guiding individuals to move past the Industrial Age"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Where you can find him: "},{"type":"reference","identifier":"http:\/\/sethgodin.typepad.com","isActive":true},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"isActive":true,"identifier":"http:\/\/www.sethgodin.com\/sg\/books.asp","type":"reference"},{"type":"text","text":", and on a "},{"type":"reference","isActive":true,"identifier":"http:\/\/grantland.com\/hollywood-prospectus\/the-moment-podcast-brian-koppelman-and-seth-godin\/"},{"type":"text","text":" "},{"identifier":"http:\/\/www.stansberryradio.com\/James-Altucher\/Latest-Episodes\/Episode\/886\/Ep-86-Seth-Godin-It-s-Your-Turn-Now-What","type":"reference","isActive":true},{"text":" ","type":"text"},{"type":"reference","identifier":"http:\/\/www.onbeing.org\/program\/seth-godin-on-the-art-of-noticing-and-then-creating\/5000","isActive":true}]},{"text":"Horace Dediu","anchor":"Horace-Dediu","level":3,"type":"heading"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Expertise: Business, in particular why businesses fail or succeed","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Where you can find him: "},{"isActive":true,"type":"reference","identifier":"http:\/\/asymco.com"},{"type":"text","text":", "},{"identifier":"http:\/\/5by5.tv\/criticalpath","type":"reference","isActive":true},{"type":"text","text":", and the "},{"identifier":"http:\/\/www.asymcar.com","isActive":true,"type":"reference"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Just looking at this list I know I need more diversity in my super smart people.
