I’ve recently told near-strangers that I think they use too many hashtags, that their programming language of choice is awful, and that I disagree with their political positions.

I feel like I am a fairly binary person where I see many things as ones and zeros."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"But another side of me wants me to be balanced. To look at both sides of an argument and see them both at the same time. I see the beauty of this perspective and that this world needs balance.

I don’t want to increase suffering."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"But then I worry that I do the world a disservice by being the balanced me. Many times I will state both sides of an argument rather than to share my opinion. I worry that my strong opinions will overwhelm the more weakly held opinions of the people I work with. Am I hiding from the responsibility of making or influencing that decision? Am I just avoiding conflict? How much should I temper my personality?","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I really don’t know.
