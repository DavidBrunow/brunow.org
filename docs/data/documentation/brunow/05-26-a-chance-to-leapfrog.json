But now I’ve been using Swift every day while they’ve continued to write Objective C and my skills in that area — an area that is the future of all Apple product development — is stronger than theirs. I’ve come from way behind to be ahead. I see that as a strong advantage."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Look around and you’ll see that my example is just one of many times this has happened.
