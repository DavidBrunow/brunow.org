For example, the Swift programming language came out shortly before we started our company. I’d written some Objective C (the language used for Apple device development before Swift) code before but it hasn’t been my full-time job and I was behind many others in that skill set. But now I’ve been using Swift every day while they’ve continued to write Objective C and my skills in that area — an area that is the future of all Apple product development — is stronger than theirs. I’ve come from way behind to be ahead. I see that as a strong advantage.","type":"text"}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Look around and you’ll see that my example is just one of many times this has happened.
