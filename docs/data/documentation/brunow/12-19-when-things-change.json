It is much easier to go with the flow and believe that everything will always be the same, rather than having a vision of what the future is bringing and adapting to that before it sweeps you away. Plus, things that have been around all our lives feel permanent even if they’ve lived very short lives relative to the rest of the world."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"The big shift I see happening right now is in education.
