First is the building phase where I put all the design elements together and lay them out close to the design but not precisely.

I also find that after working on the functionality for 15 hours over two days that I don’t have the energy or perspective to get the design right. My perspective I mean that I’m too close to it from looking at it so long and I wouldn’t know whether it was right or wrong."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"The next phase is the polish phase.
