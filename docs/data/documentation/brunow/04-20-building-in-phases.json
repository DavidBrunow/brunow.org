I also find that after working on the functionality for 15 hours over two days that I don’t have the energy or perspective to get the design right. My perspective I mean that I’m too close to it from looking at it so long and I wouldn’t know whether it was right or wrong.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"The next phase is the polish phase.
