First is the building phase where I put all the design elements together and lay them out close to the design but not precisely. During this phase I’m concentrating on functionality and making things work rights so the design isn’t the priority. I also find that after working on the functionality for 15 hours over two days that I don’t have the energy or perspective to get the design right. My perspective I mean that I’m too close to it from looking at it so long and I wouldn’t know whether it was right or wrong."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"The next phase is the polish phase.
