Something is always changing. The sun will not come up tomorrow at the same time it did today.

That “magic” line of code will only work in a couple of browsers and doesn’t do anything in the others."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"In some cases you can get away with waiting until something changes to learn how everything works. Unfortunately, with the world being as complex as it is, this strategy can become overwhelming quickly when you have a bad week and have to figure out how 5-10 different things work at the same time. I recommend that most of the time you figure out how something works the first time you encounter it.
