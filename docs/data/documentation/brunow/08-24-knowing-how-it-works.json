Knowing that the sun comes up everyday at a semi-regular time is almost as useful as knowing how the celestial bodies are floating through space.

Something is always changing. The sun will not come up tomorrow at the same time it did today.

Unfortunately, with the world being as complex as it is, this strategy can become overwhelming quickly when you have a bad week and have to figure out how 5-10 different things work at the same time. I recommend that most of the time you figure out how something works the first time you encounter it.
