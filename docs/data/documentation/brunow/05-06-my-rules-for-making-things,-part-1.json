Having fewer plans means you are less likely to get attached to any one way of solving a problem and puts the problem solving where it should be — in the creation phase instead of the preparation phase. This also works for me because I do smaller projects with fewer people. I do all the early versions of a project and then bring others in when I have enough created to have a discussion around."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"The simplest of tools will work for this — I usually use eraseable crayon on a window for a dry-erase-like experience but a pencil and paper do just as well."}]}]},{"content":[{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Understand the problem as well possible before starting - You can’t possibly know everything about the problem you are trying to solve before you start on the solution, but you should have a good handle on what it is. It is very easy to start trying to solve the problem before you know anything about it. Usually in these cases you will start with a solution to a problem you’ve seen before and not quite address the needs of the current problem. While your experience can be greatly beneficial it can also be a hindrance. If you don’t explicitly avoid it, you will try to solve every problem the same way."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"The only tools for this part of the process are good questions, good listening, and a lot of time to think, both consciously and unconsciously.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"}]}]}]}],"kind":"article","variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/05-06-my-rules-for-making-things,-part-1"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","schemaVersion":{"patch":0,"major":0,"minor":3},"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/05-06-my-rules-for-making-things,-part-1","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"abstract":[{"text":"date: 2015-05-06T10:16:33-05:00","type":"text"}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","title":"Brunow","role":"collection","kind":"symbol","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
