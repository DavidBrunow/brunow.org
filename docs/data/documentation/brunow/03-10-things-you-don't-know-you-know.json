Until I stop and think about it, I’d tell you that I don’t really use math at all.

I can’t think like a beginner. This is the bias we all fall into when we know something well. It’s one of the stages of learning — you start knowing nothing, then you learn more and more until you know enough to be useful, and then master it. And the master doesn’t know how much she knows."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I’ve encountered this before but I only applied the idea to software development.
