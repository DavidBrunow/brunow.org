It is difficult to get people and companies to “do the right thing” with no other incentive than it being the right thing. Penalties for not doing the right thing (by which I do not mean breaking the law, which I would instead consider “doing the wrong thing”) are rare and small. Making things seem worse than they are and giving them a catchy name that infers how bad they are are ways to inspire compliance."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"This kind of alarmism isn’t my thing. Maybe that’s because I’m the type that does the research to know what the real implications of a change are.

I apply that knowledge seeking in everything I do.
