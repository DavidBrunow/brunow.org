It is difficult to get people and companies to “do the right thing” with no other incentive than it being the right thing. Penalties for not doing the right thing (by which I do not mean breaking the law, which I would instead consider “doing the wrong thing”) are rare and small. Making things seem worse than they are and giving them a catchy name that infers how bad they are are ways to inspire compliance."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"This kind of alarmism isn’t my thing. Maybe that’s because I’m the type that does the research to know what the real implications of a change are. When I was a Compliance Officer at a bank I read pending regulatory changes and knew where we stood with them. Having that knowledge makes everything less scary. I apply that knowledge seeking in everything I do. It is funny to think that my role as a web designer uses skills from my role as a bank Compliance Officer."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"If you ask me about a scary pending change, I’ll give you an answer based upon research and I’ll explain my logic about how you should react.
