I don’t know wood, leather, or metal working. But I know that if I did, then I’d do everything by hand. I’d purposefully use less efficient techniques because I think that they will result in better products. They’d have more humanity and people would be able to feel the care that I’d put into them."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"It seems silly, but I take a similar approach when working with technology. Tonight we went to an informative class about Drupal, which is a Content Management System (CMS) that allows you to build sites with a lot of content and contributors quickly and relatively easily. But that’s just not the way I want to do things — it isn’t right for me."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"I still don’t believe that a small business needs a CMS. And while I can do it, I’d rather not build a site that requires one. My preference will always be to build a site by hand using HTML and CSS, taking the time and care for every decision and every detail. My fingerprint will be on everything and you’ll feel the humanity and caring.","type":"text"}]}],"kind":"content"}],"abstract":[{"text":"date: 2015-10-20T23:03:51-05:00","type":"text"}],"sections":[],"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/10-20-hand-tools"]}],"kind":"article","identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/10-20-hand-tools","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2015"]]},"schemaVersion":{"patch":0,"minor":3,"major":0},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","role":"collection","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","kind":"symbol","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
