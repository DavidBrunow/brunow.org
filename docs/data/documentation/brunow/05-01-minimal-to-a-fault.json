Well, I really wanted it to exist, so I built it anyway."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Fully knowing the burden of the flaw[^2], I made choices to allow setting your alarm every night to be as simple as possible. I added the ability for the alarm to start automatically at launch, so you only have to tap the icon to set the alarm. I designed the time input so that you can directly choose the numbers for the time you want to wake up, instead of scrolling back and forth in a picker like in a typical alarm app. And you don’t have to choose am or pm, because the app picks the next occurrence within 12 hours. With this design, choosing 6:30 am takes 3 taps."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"I’ve used this app almost every night for the past year.
