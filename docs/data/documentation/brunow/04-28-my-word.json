If I have to choose between feeding myself and keeping my word then I’ll go hungry. I can’t always keep my word — things happen — but every day I have the simple opportunity to keep my word by being where I say I’ll be. If I RSVP that I’ll attend, I’m there. If I say I’ll be at a meeting then I’ll be there. In some ways those little things are more important than the big — anyone can show up for one time when the stakes are high. The challenge is showing up every day when you think no one is watching."}],"type":"paragraph"}]}],"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/04-28-my-word"]}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"title":"Brunow","kind":"symbol","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
