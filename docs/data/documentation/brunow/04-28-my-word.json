If I have to choose between feeding myself and keeping my word then I’ll go hungry. I can’t always keep my word — things happen — but every day I have the simple opportunity to keep my word by being where I say I’ll be. If I RSVP that I’ll attend, I’m there. If I say I’ll be at a meeting then I’ll be there. In some ways those little things are more important than the big — anyone can show up for one time when the stakes are high. The challenge is showing up every day when you think no one is watching."}]}]}],"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/04-28-my-word"]}],"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016"]]},"sections":[],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"role":"collectionGroup","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016","abstract":[],"kind":"article","title":"2016","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016","type":"topic"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","title":"Brunow","role":"collection","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
