I can’t always keep my word — things happen — but every day I have the simple opportunity to keep my word by being where I say I’ll be. If I RSVP that I’ll attend, I’m there. If I say I’ll be at a meeting then I’ll be there. In some ways those little things are more important than the big — anyone can show up for one time when the stakes are high. The challenge is showing up every day when you think no one is watching."}]}],"kind":"content"}],"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"date: 2016-04-28T07:06:06-05:00"}],"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/04-28-my-word"]}],"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/04-28-my-word","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"kind":"article","hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016"]]},"sections":[],"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","schemaVersion":{"major":0,"patch":0,"minor":3},"metadata":{"title":"My Word","modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}],"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"},"platforms":[{"name":"Brunow","introducedAt":"2017.01.20"}]},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"role":"collectionGroup","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016","title":"2016","abstract":[],"kind":"article","type":"topic"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"type":"topic","title":"Brunow","role":"collection","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","kind":"symbol","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
