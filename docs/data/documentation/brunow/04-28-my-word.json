I can’t always keep my word — things happen — but every day I have the simple opportunity to keep my word by being where I say I’ll be. If I RSVP that I’ll attend, I’m there. If I say I’ll be at a meeting then I’ll be there. In some ways those little things are more important than the big — anyone can show up for one time when the stakes are high. The challenge is showing up every day when you think no one is watching."}]}]}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"role":"collectionGroup","title":"2016","type":"topic","kind":"article","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016","abstract":[],"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","kind":"article","title":"Archive","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"All posts"}],"role":"collectionGroup","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"role":"collection","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
