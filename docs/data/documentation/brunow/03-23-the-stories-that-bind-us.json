Stories like “I’m not a morning person, I never have been” or “Even as a kid I didn’t like to run and play so I’m just not meant for exercise.” These stories can be a great way to share information about yourself and a way to form bonds with others that have similar stories (more elaborate stories than my examples above.) But these stories are dangerous."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"The stories you tell yourself reinforce your actions each time you tell them.
