What I’ll do is name a variable something different than what it is or print something to the console that says the wrong thing. So I’ll print “banana is changing” when in actuality the code has apple changing and try to remember in my head that in fact it is not banana that is changing each time I read the message. My memory fails in this situation on a regular basis. I’ll confuse myself and start debugging my code to figure out why banana is changing when it should be apple.
