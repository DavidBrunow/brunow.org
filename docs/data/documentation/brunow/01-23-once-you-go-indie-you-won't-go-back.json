That human being deeply cares about what she creates. I know that because if she didn’t then she wouldn’t be able to make a living off of it.

That’s even better in my eyes.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Just like a small business on Main Street, indie software creators really want to make you happy.
