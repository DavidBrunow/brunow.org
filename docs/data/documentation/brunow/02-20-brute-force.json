Pushing an obstacle out of the way because you don’t have the time, skills, or tools to do something more intelligently. But you will get worn out and brute force is not sustainable. For anything more than short term efforts it makes sense to grab a tool or learn the skills to do something smarter.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"There is a balance and no right answer.

I don’t understand how the Android UI layout system works so I’m just trying different combinations until I find one that works.
