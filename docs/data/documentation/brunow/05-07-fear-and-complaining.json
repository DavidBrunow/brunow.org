My example is about Apple and the passionate folk who want to give Apple advice.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Take a designer on Twitter saying that Apple needs to do something different with their design of iOS.

Or Apple will become irrelevant or fail as a company and they don’t want that because they love the company. The root of the fear is a lack of trust that the folks at Apple know what they are doing. These outsiders want to feel like they’re doing something — that they are contributing — so they do so by complaining."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"Is it a good thing that they complain? It is productive in the cliche “squeaky wheel” way? I don’t know. Personally, I want Apple to have their vision for the future that doesn’t rely upon outsiders complaining.
