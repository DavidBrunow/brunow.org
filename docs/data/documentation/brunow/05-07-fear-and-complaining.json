My example is about Apple and the passionate folk who want to give Apple advice."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Take a designer on Twitter saying that Apple needs to do something different with their design of iOS.

Or Apple will become irrelevant or fail as a company and they don’t want that because they love the company. The root of the fear is a lack of trust that the folks at Apple know what they are doing. These outsiders want to feel like they’re doing something — that they are contributing — so they do so by complaining."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Is it a good thing that they complain? It is productive in the cliche “squeaky wheel” way? I don’t know. Personally, I want Apple to have their vision for the future that doesn’t rely upon outsiders complaining. Of course there needs to be a balance between getting outside input and sticking with your vision but I think that balance should be heavily weighted towards the vision."}],"type":"paragraph"}]}],"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/05-07-fear-and-complaining"]}],"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016"]]},"sections":[],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","title":"Brunow","role":"collection","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
