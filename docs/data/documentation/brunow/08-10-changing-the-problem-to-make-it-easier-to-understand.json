It was something like “if this isn’t true and this isn’t true and this isn’t true and this isn’t true then do this.” I wanted to alter two of those “this isn’t true” statements so that they were “this isn’t true and this isn’t true but only if this other thing is true.” With the way I had the problem laid out I couldn’t figure out how to do what I wanted."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"So I changed the problem. I made it “if this is true or this is true or this is true or this is true and this is not true” then do the opposite of what I was first doing.
