But I ran into problems with this concept. Where would a new user start in reading the story? If I put them at the beginning of the book then they would get the full effect of the story. However, my friends and family that checked back often would have to jump through hurdles to get to the new stuff. Additionally, in a children’s book there is generally one picture and caption per page.

As I learned after diving into this, HTML5 video is a bit of a pain in its current form, which I attribute to Firefox’s insistence on not supporting the H.264 format.

Not supporting Firefox has given "},{"type":"reference","isActive":true,"identifier":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/paraboloo\/status\/355400925713661952"},{"type":"text","text":", but I had to make a decision based upon my particular constraints, and one of those constraints is that I would like to be able to make the posts completely from the file system on my iOS devices. From my research, it isn’t super straightforward to export Ogg Vorbis from the iPhone and even if I did that, I would be using twice as much space to store each video, which is just a waste.
