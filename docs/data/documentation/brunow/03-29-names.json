He said that only the company itself gets any value out of a name. I replied that the company’s customers also get value out of that name. For example, when I go to buy an Apple product I want to know that what I’m getting is made by Apple. I buy their products because their name means quality to me and their values align with mine.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"These names don’t only matter for high end electronics, which are obviously discretionary purchases and not necessities.
