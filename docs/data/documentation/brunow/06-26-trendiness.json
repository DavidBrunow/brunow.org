In fashion, look at what people are wearing and see the patterns. If you repeatedly see the same item or style then it is probably in fashion at that time, most likely for some reason that seems completely arbitrary and makes no sense to me. Like how black athletic socks are now trendy and white ones aren’t — the opposite of what I grew up knowing."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"But I still don’t have any desire to be trendy myself.
