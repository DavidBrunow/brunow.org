Fortunately, my business partner and girlfriend complements my strengths with her own and we have little overlap between the two.

I am awful at seeing dangerous patterns or shapes that aren’t moving. I know this because Brandy and I used to go walking on a trail that frequently had copperheads laying across it. I never was able to spot those snakes before she did and a couple of times I was walking too close to them before she pointed them out. That’s definitely my weakness and her strength. But if something is moving I spot it far more quickly than she does. So if something is lying in wait for us she sees it and if something is pursuing us then I’ll see it."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"That’s a pretty good balance.","type":"text"}]}],"kind":"content"}],"variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/06-01-different-strengths"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/06-01-different-strengths","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"schemaVersion":{"minor":3,"patch":0,"major":0},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"kind":"article","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","title":"Archive","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"All posts"}],"type":"topic","role":"collectionGroup"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","kind":"symbol","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
