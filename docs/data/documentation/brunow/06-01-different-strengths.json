Fortunately, my business partner and girlfriend complements my strengths with her own and we have little overlap between the two. She’s great at things I’m not and vice versa.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Here’s a great example that isn’t business related, instead it is survival related (which obviously overlaps business at least a bit). I am awful at seeing dangerous patterns or shapes that aren’t moving. I know this because Brandy and I used to go walking on a trail that frequently had copperheads laying across it. I never was able to spot those snakes before she did and a couple of times I was walking too close to them before she pointed them out. That’s definitely my weakness and her strength. But if something is moving I spot it far more quickly than she does. So if something is lying in wait for us she sees it and if something is pursuing us then I’ll see it."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"That’s a pretty good balance."}],"type":"paragraph"}]}],"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/06-01-different-strengths"]}],"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016"]]},"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/06-01-different-strengths","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"date: 2016-06-01T23:23:34-05:00"}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","kind":"article","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","title":"Archive","type":"topic","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"All posts"}],"role":"collectionGroup"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"kind":"article","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016","title":"2016","role":"collectionGroup","abstract":[],"type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
