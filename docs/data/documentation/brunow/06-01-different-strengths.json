Fortunately, my business partner and girlfriend complements my strengths with her own and we have little overlap between the two. She’s great at things I’m not and vice versa.","type":"text"}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Here’s a great example that isn’t business related, instead it is survival related (which obviously overlaps business at least a bit). I am awful at seeing dangerous patterns or shapes that aren’t moving. I know this because Brandy and I used to go walking on a trail that frequently had copperheads laying across it. I never was able to spot those snakes before she did and a couple of times I was walking too close to them before she pointed them out. That’s definitely my weakness and her strength. But if something is moving I spot it far more quickly than she does. So if something is lying in wait for us she sees it and if something is pursuing us then I’ll see it."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"That’s a pretty good balance.","type":"text"}]}]}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016","title":"2016","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016","abstract":[],"kind":"article","role":"collectionGroup"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"kind":"article","type":"topic","title":"Archive","abstract":[{"text":"All posts","type":"text"}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","role":"collectionGroup","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"type":"topic","title":"Brunow","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","kind":"symbol","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
