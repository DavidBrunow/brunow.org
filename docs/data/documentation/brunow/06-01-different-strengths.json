I am awful at seeing dangerous patterns or shapes that aren’t moving. I know this because Brandy and I used to go walking on a trail that frequently had copperheads laying across it. I never was able to spot those snakes before she did and a couple of times I was walking too close to them before she pointed them out. That’s definitely my weakness and her strength. But if something is moving I spot it far more quickly than she does. So if something is lying in wait for us she sees it and if something is pursuing us then I’ll see it."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"That’s a pretty good balance."}]}]}],"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","kind":"article","references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","kind":"article","role":"collectionGroup","title":"Archive","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"All posts"}]},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"type":"topic","role":"collection","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
