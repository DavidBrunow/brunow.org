Every day I learn more about my strengths and weaknesses and figure out I’m not as strong in some areas as I once thought.

I am awful at seeing dangerous patterns or shapes that aren’t moving. I know this because Brandy and I used to go walking on a trail that frequently had copperheads laying across it. I never was able to spot those snakes before she did and a couple of times I was walking too close to them before she pointed them out. That’s definitely my weakness and her strength. But if something is moving I spot it far more quickly than she does. So if something is lying in wait for us she sees it and if something is pursuing us then I’ll see it.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"That’s a pretty good balance."}],"type":"paragraph"}],"kind":"content"}],"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/06-01-different-strengths","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"type":"topic","kind":"article","role":"collectionGroup","abstract":[],"title":"2016","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"type":"topic","role":"collection","title":"Brunow","kind":"symbol","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
