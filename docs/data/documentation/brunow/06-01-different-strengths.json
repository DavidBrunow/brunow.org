I am awful at seeing dangerous patterns or shapes that aren’t moving. I know this because Brandy and I used to go walking on a trail that frequently had copperheads laying across it. I never was able to spot those snakes before she did and a couple of times I was walking too close to them before she pointed them out. That’s definitely my weakness and her strength.
