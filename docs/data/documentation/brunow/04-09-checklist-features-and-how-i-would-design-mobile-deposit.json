I am guessing that someone manually looks at each set of images and makes the deposit manually, and that this is why it would it take days to receive a confirmation. That long confirmation time could also be explained by Chase waiting to get the funds from the other bank before approving the deposit, but I hope not, because this is poor way of handling this problem. I am not usually an advocate of pestering a customer with confirmations, but when it comes to money, I don’t think you can give too many. In this case, give the customer two confirmations, one saying that the deposit is good and another saying when the funds are available.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"In summary, in Chase’s implementation the iPhone is being used to digitally hand the checks to a teller."}]},{"type":"heading","level":2,"anchor":"Brunow","text":"Brunow"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Here is how I would implement it:"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"First, I would have the customer take a picture of the front and the back of the check.

The server would do additional image quality checks and then use OCR to determine guesses for the routing number, account number, check number, check date, and amount. The first three have a high likelihood of being correct, since checks in the United States all use the same font. The amount and check date would be more difficult, since it could be typed in any font or even handwritten. Therefore, after the check has been OCRed, the server would send the information back to the phone for confirmation by the customer.
