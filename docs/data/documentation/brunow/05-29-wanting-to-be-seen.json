Maybe we go at a different time and none of the dogs are out. Or maybe they are locked in the house because it is too wet out. Whatever it is, it seems to throw Dozer off a bit.

He seems to believe that something is wrong.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Here is one interpretation that makes sense to me. A forest becomes quiet when a large threat is lurking. No creature wants to give away its location when it is threatened.
