Maybe we go at a different time and none of the dogs are out. Or maybe they are locked in the house because it is too wet out. Whatever it is, it seems to throw Dozer off a bit. He stares at the yard that usually has barking dogs as we walk by and he seems tense and more alert. He seems to believe that something is wrong.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Here is one interpretation that makes sense to me.
