He made a comment about how you want to avoid state in your program because state is where the bugs are. I know he is a much more experienced programmer, but I can’t get my mind wrapped around what he’s saying enough to agree. I think that state is one of the best parts of programming or, more specifically, building systems that maintain and change state over time."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"In my mind, complexity is where the bugs are.
