I want to encourage her to crawl, walk, potty train, and eat and drink on her own. She only spends every other weekend and Wednesday nights with me. I fear that that just isn’t enough time for me to push her forward on those things. They require consistency that I just can’t provide on this schedule."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I’m terribly saddened by this thought.

On my ability to be more than a relative she sees every other weekend."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I’m not looking for sympathy — I’m just sharing my pain with the world. I put myself in this situation and I knew it would be hard. And I continue to have faith that I’ll be able to shape her life as she grows up — especially once we can sense each other’s souls.
