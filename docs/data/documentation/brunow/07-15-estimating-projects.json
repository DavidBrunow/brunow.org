The problem is when the code you’ve written is as efficient as it can be and you have to start figuring out tricks to make further improvements. Like animation this is an iterative and time consuming process as you make a change, benchmark and compare it to the previous iteration, and so on.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"So I’ve figured out that these things take extra time but I still don’t have a good idea of how much extra time that is.
