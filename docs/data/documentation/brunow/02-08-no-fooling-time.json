Part of that is because I have a handful of projects all going at once that I need to move forward on. The other part of it is that I’ve always been quick at building things and I didn’t feel like time applied to me — it was this imaginary thing that I could bend at my will.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I’m still much quicker than other people’s expectations.

One project running long can affect every other project. You can easily make up that time if you have slack.
