In this version, any cropping of videos or images must be done in the Photos app, but at least everything can be done on the phone.","type":"text"}]},{"anchor":"Limitations","level":3,"type":"heading","text":"Limitations"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"Since the iOS app is not actually putting the file on your server when you press the “Post” button, some other process must be running to do so.

You will also see a “Save” button. That button will upload the file to Dropbox, as will going back to the drafts screen. The file is automatically saved locally every five seconds. I have also included a button to add media, whether an image or a video. As I said before, this button will add the media to your Dropbox and place the proper tag at the cursor location in your file."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"I think I am handling conflict resolution for the versions of files in a conservative manner.
