I have no problem not saying goodbye when leaving a party or ignoring the fact that it is a person’s birthday when I see them rather than wishing them a happy birthday. This applies to social media as well, where I have no problem ignoring a request to like a page or an event. My reasoning is that I want my likes to be pure (which, now that I am typing this, also means they are more valuable) and by pure I mean that I genuinely like the things I like."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I think I’m in the minority.

For instance, when a local high school football player is going door-to-door selling something to raise money for the team and stops at my house, I feel a social obligation to give money (which is kind of strange, given the examples of times I don’t feel socially obligated that I listed above.) I’ll buy something from that kid if that something is in the $10-$20 range. But that small amount of money won’t get a business that far, if a person even feels the same kind of social obligation."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I can’t answer my question right now even though I’ve been thinking about it quite a bit.
