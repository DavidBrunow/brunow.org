It is easy to say “never give up” but that isn’t the right answer. It also isn’t the right time simply because you run into a little adversity. And the right time depends on what you’re doing. Are you wanting to give up on training that new hire and deciding to let him go? That needs to happen sooner rather than later. Are you wanting to give up on adding a feature a client asked for? That shouldn’t happen until you’ve come to the conclusion that what they want is impossible or outside of your abilities (and really, only impossible things are outside of your abilities.)"}]}]}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016","abstract":[],"role":"collectionGroup","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016","title":"2016","type":"topic","kind":"article"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"type":"topic","role":"collection","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
