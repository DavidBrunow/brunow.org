That shouldn’t happen until you’ve come to the conclusion that what they want is impossible or outside of your abilities (and really, only impossible things are outside of your abilities.)","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"}]}],"metadata":{"platforms":[{"introducedAt":"2017.01.20","name":"Brunow"}],"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"},"title":"Time To Give Up","modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}]},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","role":"collection","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","kind":"symbol","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
