Because they are rare you are unlikely to have the perfect tool but because they are simple you can probably adapt one you already have.

It is still easy to find tools although they are generally more expensive than simple tools. Due to the high level of complexity the tool must have more generic features in order to keep the problem common and to solve it for as many people as possible. But due to the tool being more generic, you must adapt to it. Most computers and software would be in this category. For example, if you need to send email newsletters you have a variety of tools available but you will need to learn the way they work rather than it adapting to your needs. You have to follow its workflow."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"The bottom right quadrant contains complicated and uncommon tasks. For these you usually have to create your own tools.
