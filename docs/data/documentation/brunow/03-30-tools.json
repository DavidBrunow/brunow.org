For example, here in the southern United States we don’t get much winter weather so I don’t have a tool for getting ice off my windshield, but a credit card will do the job."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"The top right quadrant is complicated but common tasks. It is still easy to find tools although they are generally more expensive than simple tools. Due to the high level of complexity the tool must have more generic features in order to keep the problem common and to solve it for as many people as possible. But due to the tool being more generic, you must adapt to it. Most computers and software would be in this category. For example, if you need to send email newsletters you have a variety of tools available but you will need to learn the way they work rather than it adapting to your needs. You have to follow its workflow."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"The bottom right quadrant contains complicated and uncommon tasks. For these you usually have to create your own tools. For example, if you’ve created a piece of hardware with novel functionality and you want to be able to control it with your phone over the Internet you won’t find an off-the-shelf solution. This is the quadrant I like to live in because I really like creating these tools for people."}],"type":"paragraph"}],"kind":"content"}],"kind":"article","topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016"]]},"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"date: 2016-03-30T22:26:19-05:00"}],"schemaVersion":{"patch":0,"minor":3,"major":0},"metadata":{"platforms":[{"name":"Brunow","introducedAt":"2017.01.20"}],"title":"Tools","color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"},"modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}]},"identifier":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/03-30-tools"},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"role":"collection","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
