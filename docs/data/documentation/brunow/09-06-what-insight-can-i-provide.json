I’ve been an entrepreneur for the last 18 or so months and while thinking about it earlier today I struggled to come up with lessons I could share with someone else wanting to do the same thing. I have to ask myself what insight I can provide when I feel like I haven’t proven myself and even if I have then I know there’s no guarantee that what I did will work for you. At this point I can’t confidently share any business fundamentals that are critical to success."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"What I can share is what I’ve experienced without the insight.
