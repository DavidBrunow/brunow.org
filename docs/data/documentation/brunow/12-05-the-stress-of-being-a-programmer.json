I’m required to say “this thing will work” while knowing all the things that could go wrong. Knowing that I am fallible as all humans. Knowing that many parts of the infrastructure of technology are flaky. The things I make have to be ready for anything and I don’t always meet that burden. Sometimes it feels like the opposite is true — that everything I’ve made is broken and in need of repair. To be fair to myself though, I see most of the world as broken and in need of repair."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"The stress gets to me.
