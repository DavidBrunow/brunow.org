This response’s purpose is to keep you alive. Predators do their best to ensure that you don’t see them coming so what you do see is in the details.

And it is the details that matter more than the big red flags. Someone might just be really different and that is weird to you, but you can write that off to diversity. But a small difference, a feeling that the person is just a little bit odd, triggers a bigger response. You don’t know why, but you don’t trust that person."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"So let’s say your a good business person, like most of you are.
