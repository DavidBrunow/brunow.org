In other words, what causes the mediocrity? They each had a famous cast, most of whom had been in other good movies. Did they have young directors? Was the story just so bad it couldn’t be salvaged? Was the singular goal to make a movie that would gross a certain amount while staying under a certain cost?"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"I don’t know enough about the movie industry to say.
