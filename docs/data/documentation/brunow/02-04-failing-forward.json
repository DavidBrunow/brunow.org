You can choose to restore everything to a recent known good state, reexamine what went wrong, and try again to get it right the next chance you get. Or you can find the problems that are happening now, fix them, and move forward with the new thing in place."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Neither answer is the right answer for every situation but I always try to fail forward first. Usually problems are simple enough to fix that restoring from backup will take more time. Plus, you can’t guarantee that you’ll find out why it failed the first time.
