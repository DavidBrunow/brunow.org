We move less and do the same things repeatedly. Our bodies atrophy and our minds grow bored without the novelty of change.

And I don’t mean the youth that the media idolizes in order to sell their agenda, like all these so called child prodigies. I mean youth as a whole. The youth that grow up with a smartphone in their hands are starting far ahead of where we did.
