And I don’t mean the youth that the media idolizes in order to sell their agenda, like all these so called child prodigies. I mean youth as a whole. The youth that grow up with a smartphone in their hands are starting far ahead of where we did. Today’s technology will be second nature to them, just as yesterday’s technology was second nature to us. This allows their mind to work in ways that ours don’t naturally and probably can’t.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"If we continue lengthening our lives in an endless quest to live forever we do so while crippling the future of our race.
