Examples are opt-out systems that require a person to take some action to stop something from happening. Many studies have shown that opt-out systems cause many more people to sign up for something than if they’d had to opt-in to it. They’ve taken the path of least resistance and trusted that the defaults will work for them OK. Unfortunately that’s becoming less and less true as industries discover how to use these patterns and flaws in our wiring against us."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"I believe that everyone who builds technology should take a stand against these bad practices.
