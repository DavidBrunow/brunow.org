The language is undergoing big changes which will likely irritate many people. Every project that has been created in Swift will need to have at least one line of code changed and likely more.

They have a higher standard that their pushing themselves toward and they knew they didn’t get there on the first iteration so they are making the necessary changes."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Almost all the code I’ve written over the last two years has been in Swift and each of the projects will need to be modified.
