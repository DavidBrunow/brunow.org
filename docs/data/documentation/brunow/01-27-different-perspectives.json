I don’t know an answer to this other than “lead by example.”","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Second, how does a person cultivate the ability to see these different perspectives? I think the best way is providing a variety of life experiences in vastly different situations. I’ve lived the life of a poor person, a rich person, an athlete, a nerd, a criminal, a good citizen, a soldier, and a pacifist. Putting yourself in foreign situations is a good thing even if it feels uncomfortable. But even if you can’t put yourself in all those different situations right now you can still notice how other people live. Listen to their stories without needing to tell your own.","type":"text"}]}]}],"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/01-27-different-perspectives"]}],"schemaVersion":{"major":0,"minor":3,"patch":0},"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/01-27-different-perspectives","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"kind":"article","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"date: 2016-01-27T06:35:03-06:00"}],"metadata":{"title":"Different Perspectives","modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}],"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"},"platforms":[{"introducedAt":"2017.01.20","name":"Brunow"}]},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"role":"collectionGroup","kind":"article","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016","title":"2016","abstract":[],"type":"topic"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","role":"collection","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","kind":"symbol","title":"Brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
