I couldn’t fix a parsing error if the person maintaining Mission Dharma’s website didn’t follow one of the two patterns I described above. I liked the simplicity of only needing the app and the website, but I hated how fragile the whole thing was. I hated that my name was on something that looked poorly made.

When I did get time I noticed that I had taken a shortcut in building the app and I had hard-coded the years to be parsed.

Hard-coding is bad and I know that, but I’m guessing I saw that as a very short term solution so I let it slide.

I still think these are valid reasons to make the decision I made, but if I had it to do over again I would have done it differently.
