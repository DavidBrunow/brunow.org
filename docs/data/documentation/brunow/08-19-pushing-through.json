It takes strong determination to make it all the way to 100% and not call it good enough. Fatigue sets in and every little task seems like a mountain to climb. Imagining being done and how nice that will be doesn’t help, it only makes it harder to endure the difficulty. My only advice is to find a way to focus on the parts of the work that you enjoy and let go of the rest."}]}]}],"kind":"article","variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/08-19-pushing-through"]}],"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","schemaVersion":{"major":0,"patch":0,"minor":3},"identifier":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/08-19-pushing-through"},"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"date: 2016-08-19T23:47:37-05:00"}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","title":"Brunow","role":"collection","kind":"symbol","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
