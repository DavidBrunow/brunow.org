Imagining being done and how nice that will be doesn’t help, it only makes it harder to endure the difficulty. My only advice is to find a way to focus on the parts of the work that you enjoy and let go of the rest."}],"type":"paragraph"}]}],"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/08-19-pushing-through"]}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"abstract":[],"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016","title":"2016","type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016","role":"collectionGroup","kind":"article"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"role":"collection","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","title":"Brunow","type":"topic","kind":"symbol","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
