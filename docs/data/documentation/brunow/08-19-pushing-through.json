My only advice is to find a way to focus on the parts of the work that you enjoy and let go of the rest."}]}]}],"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/08-19-pushing-through"]}],"abstract":[{"text":"date: 2016-08-19T23:47:37-05:00","type":"text"}],"kind":"article","schemaVersion":{"patch":0,"minor":3,"major":0},"identifier":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/08-19-pushing-through"},"sections":[],"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","metadata":{"modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}],"title":"Pushing Through","color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"},"platforms":[{"name":"Brunow","introducedAt":"2017.01.20"}]},"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016"]]},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
