My only advice is to find a way to focus on the parts of the work that you enjoy and let go of the rest."}]}]}],"schemaVersion":{"major":0,"minor":3,"patch":0},"sections":[],"variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/08-19-pushing-through"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/08-19-pushing-through","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"date: 2016-08-19T23:47:37-05:00"}],"kind":"article","metadata":{"platforms":[{"name":"Brunow","introducedAt":"2017.01.20"}],"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"},"title":"Pushing Through","modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}]},"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016"]]},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2016":{"role":"collectionGroup","title":"2016","abstract":[],"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016","kind":"article","type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2016"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"role":"collectionGroup","title":"Archive","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"All posts"}],"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","kind":"article","type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"role":"collection","title":"Brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
