It takes strong determination to make it all the way to 100% and not call it good enough. Fatigue sets in and every little task seems like a mountain to climb.

My only advice is to find a way to focus on the parts of the work that you enjoy and let go of the rest."}]}],"kind":"content"}],"abstract":[{"text":"date: 2016-08-19T23:47:37-05:00","type":"text"}],"sections":[],"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/08-19-pushing-through"]}],"kind":"article","hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016"]]},"identifier":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/08-19-pushing-through"},"schemaVersion":{"minor":3,"major":0,"patch":0},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"role":"collectionGroup","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"All posts"}],"title":"Archive","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","type":"topic","kind":"article","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","role":"collection","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","kind":"symbol","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
