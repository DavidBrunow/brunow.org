It takes strong determination to make it all the way to 100% and not call it good enough. Fatigue sets in and every little task seems like a mountain to climb. Imagining being done and how nice that will be doesn’t help, it only makes it harder to endure the difficulty. My only advice is to find a way to focus on the parts of the work that you enjoy and let go of the rest."}]}]}],"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"date: 2016-08-19T23:47:37-05:00"}],"variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/08-19-pushing-through"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"kind":"article","schemaVersion":{"major":0,"minor":3,"patch":0},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"type":"topic","title":"Brunow","role":"collection","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","kind":"symbol","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
