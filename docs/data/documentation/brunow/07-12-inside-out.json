These emotions steer her through life and take over in the appropriate circumstances. All the while she is creating memories which are depicted as marbles which contain a short video of the memory and are tinted by the emotion that was in control at the time. Every once in a while a special kind of memory rolls in, called a core memory. These core memories power the fundamental structures of who she is as a person — her passions and the things she cares about most deeply.","type":"text"}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"The part I’m trying to relate to my life is this concept of core memories.
