These emotions steer her through life and take over in the appropriate circumstances. All the while she is creating memories which are depicted as marbles which contain a short video of the memory and are tinted by the emotion that was in control at the time. Every once in a while a special kind of memory rolls in, called a core memory. These core memories power the fundamental structures of who she is as a person — her passions and the things she cares about most deeply."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"The part I’m trying to relate to my life is this concept of core memories. I know that Inside Out is just a movie and not a well researched documentary about how the world works. But I also love a good analogy and I find it fun to think about. The problem is that I have no idea what my core memories could be or what the fundamental structures of who I am are. I’m going to keep thinking about it and see what I can figure out."}]}]}],"metadata":{"title":"Inside Out","modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}],"platforms":[{"introducedAt":"2017.01.20","name":"Brunow"}],"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"}},"sections":[],"identifier":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/07-12-inside-out"},"kind":"article","schemaVersion":{"minor":3,"major":0,"patch":0},"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016"]]},"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"title":"Brunow","kind":"symbol","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
