These emotions steer her through life and take over in the appropriate circumstances. All the while she is creating memories which are depicted as marbles which contain a short video of the memory and are tinted by the emotion that was in control at the time. Every once in a while a special kind of memory rolls in, called a core memory. These core memories power the fundamental structures of who she is as a person — her passions and the things she cares about most deeply."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"The part I’m trying to relate to my life is this concept of core memories. I know that Inside Out is just a movie and not a well researched documentary about how the world works. But I also love a good analogy and I find it fun to think about. The problem is that I have no idea what my core memories could be or what the fundamental structures of who I am are. I’m going to keep thinking about it and see what I can figure out.","type":"text"}]}],"kind":"content"}],"variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/07-12-inside-out"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016"]]},"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","metadata":{"title":"Inside Out","platforms":[{"name":"Brunow","introducedAt":"2017.01.20"}],"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"},"modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}]},"kind":"article","sections":[],"schemaVersion":{"major":0,"minor":3,"patch":0},"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/07-12-inside-out","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"abstract":[{"text":"date: 2016-07-12T23:14:09-05:00","type":"text"}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","title":"Archive","role":"collectionGroup","kind":"article","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","abstract":[{"text":"All posts","type":"text"}]},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","title":"Brunow","role":"collection","kind":"symbol","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
