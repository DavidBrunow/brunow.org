These emotions steer her through life and take over in the appropriate circumstances. All the while she is creating memories which are depicted as marbles which contain a short video of the memory and are tinted by the emotion that was in control at the time. Every once in a while a special kind of memory rolls in, called a core memory. These core memories power the fundamental structures of who she is as a person — her passions and the things she cares about most deeply.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"The part I’m trying to relate to my life is this concept of core memories. I know that Inside Out is just a movie and not a well researched documentary about how the world works. But I also love a good analogy and I find it fun to think about. The problem is that I have no idea what my core memories could be or what the fundamental structures of who I am are.
