For people unfamiliar with basketball lingo, a layup is a move where you dribble the ball while running towards the basket and then jump off one foot while moving the ball towards the basket with the opposite hand and gently throwing the ball into the basket. It is the most fundamental basketball move and I could not do it. Every day in practice while the team was working together I would repeatedly try to make a layup.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Many other things seem to have come easily to me in life.
