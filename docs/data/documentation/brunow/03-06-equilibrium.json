The offense for each team was unable to change the equilibrium. Each time they went down the court they would pass the ball around a few times and shoot a three pointer. Something obvious became clear — the only way for change to happen is for the system to become unbalanced. One way that happens in basketball is by a player making a move to the basket past his defender and causing another player’s defender to stop him. This unbalances the system, leaving a player open.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Writing it out it seems so obvious. But despite years of playing basketball I hadn’t put it together. I thought the purpose of each play was to try to score but now I don’t think so. I think the purpose is to cause an imbalance and the score is a nice benefit of that — an instant feedback system for good work."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"This applies everywhere. The way to cause change is to throw a system out of whack. This idea really helps me visualize the impact we can make in the world.
