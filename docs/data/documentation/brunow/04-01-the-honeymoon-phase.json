This doesn’t just apply to our relationships with other people, but our relationships with our job, technology, where we live, and everything else. When I went to Iraq in 2004 for Operation Iraqi Freedom the first couple of weeks had a “Honeymoon Phase” where everything was fun, exciting, and new. It applies as much to going to war as it does starting a new habit — for the first couple of weeks it is fun and exciting and new to get up every morning and run.","type":"text"}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"Until one day you wake up and it isn’t fun anymore. You go from a tremendous high to a pretty low low. Then if you fight through and give it a little more time, things will even out.
