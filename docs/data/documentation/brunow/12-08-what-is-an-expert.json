Could you say someone is a technology expert? So much technology exists and so much innovation is occurring that no one person can know technology authoritatively. And I don’t think the lack of expertise only applies to a field like technology. The complexity takes over too quickly. Doctors become experts at single joints or organs. Which is fine but comes at a high cost — an entire team must be deployed to solve a problem.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Most people don’t have the resources for an entire team. The health insurance industry has risen to “solve” that problem. But we don’t have a technology insurance industry to handle paying for teams to solve your technological problems.
