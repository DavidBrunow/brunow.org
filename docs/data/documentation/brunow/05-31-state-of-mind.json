The most interesting part of the experience to me is my state of mind after finding this tick on me. I feel dirty, unsafe, violated, and paranoid. With every itch I feel or imagine I’m worried about other ticks getting on me despite the likelihood of that happening at home being very low."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"This happens a lot when we encounter a small bad thing in our life.
