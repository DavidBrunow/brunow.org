In Jack’s industry, incentives are aligned through a commission system. He is incentivized to do as well as he can for his client so he can get the highest commission and the commissions can be structured to provide even more incentive by increasing the percentage of payout at different tiers. For example, the first $5 could have a 5% commission, the second $5 could have a 7% commission, and the third $5 could have a 9% commission."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Commissions work well for his industry because the outcomes are binary — his business is to help companies get bought by other companies.
