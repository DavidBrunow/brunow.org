In Jack’s industry, incentives are aligned through a commission system. He is incentivized to do as well as he can for his client so he can get the highest commission and the commissions can be structured to provide even more incentive by increasing the percentage of payout at different tiers. For example, the first $5 could have a 5% commission, the second $5 could have a 7% commission, and the third $5 could have a 9% commission."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Commissions work well for his industry because the outcomes are binary — his business is to help companies get bought by other companies.

It is difficult to directly measure the benefits of having a great website or app. But maybe, with the right amount of effort and planning, a commission based system could be setup because being able to tell someone “I will make you this much money and only want this much of it” is a great way to both get buy in and align incentives.
