I start with the most simple situation possible by hard coding known good values. For example, if I’m logging a user into a system I won’t build the part to get the username and password from the user at the start. I’ll code a username and password that I know will work directly into the application. That means that if the logging in process doesn’t work that it is something wrong with the way I am sending the information rather than somehow sending the wrong information."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Hard coding those variables naturally leads to seeing things happen faster. I’m not building an entire user interface for a login screen just to be able to log in, I’m building one small piece of code that I get to see work within a few hours.","type":"text"}]}],"kind":"content"}],"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","kind":"article","variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/02-06-limiting-variables-and-seeing-things-happen"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016"]]},"sections":[],"schemaVersion":{"patch":0,"major":0,"minor":3},"identifier":{"interfaceLanguage":"swift","url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/02-06-limiting-variables-and-seeing-things-happen"},"abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"date: 2016-02-06T08:25:45-06:00"}],"references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","abstract":[{"text":"All posts","type":"text"}],"kind":"article","type":"topic","role":"collectionGroup","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","title":"Archive"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","kind":"symbol","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","type":"topic","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
