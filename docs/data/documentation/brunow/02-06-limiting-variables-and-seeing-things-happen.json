I start with the most simple situation possible by hard coding known good values. For example, if I’m logging a user into a system I won’t build the part to get the username and password from the user at the start. I’ll code a username and password that I know will work directly into the application. That means that if the logging in process doesn’t work that it is something wrong with the way I am sending the information rather than somehow sending the wrong information."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"Hard coding those variables naturally leads to seeing things happen faster.
