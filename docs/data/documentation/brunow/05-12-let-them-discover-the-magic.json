For the demonstration I just opened the Notes app, handed him the Pencil, and let him go. He got to decide what he wanted to try — he chose how the product revealed itself to him. I could have walked him through all the features but then he would miss out on discovering the magic himself. Plus, features I like may not matter to him because he may not be able to picture himself using it the same way I would."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"When introducing someone to a product it is best to do as little as possible and let them connect the dots."}],"type":"paragraph"}]}],"schemaVersion":{"minor":3,"patch":0,"major":0},"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/05-12-let-them-discover-the-magic","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"kind":"article","abstract":[{"text":"date: 2016-05-12T07:24:35-05:00","type":"text"}],"sections":[],"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016"]]},"variants":[{"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/05-12-let-them-discover-the-magic"],"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}]}],"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"All posts"}],"kind":"article","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","role":"collectionGroup","title":"Archive","type":"topic"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","title":"Brunow","role":"collection","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
