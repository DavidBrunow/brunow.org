For the demonstration I just opened the Notes app, handed him the Pencil, and let him go. He got to decide what he wanted to try — he chose how the product revealed itself to him. I could have walked him through all the features but then he would miss out on discovering the magic himself. Plus, features I like may not matter to him because he may not be able to picture himself using it the same way I would."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"When introducing someone to a product it is best to do as little as possible and let them connect the dots."}]}]}],"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/05-12-let-them-discover-the-magic"]}],"schemaVersion":{"major":0,"minor":3,"patch":0},"kind":"article","sections":[],"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/05-12-let-them-discover-the-magic","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2016"]]},"abstract":[{"text":"date: 2016-05-12T07:24:35-05:00","type":"text"}],"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"kind":"article","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","title":"Archive","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"All posts"}],"type":"topic","role":"collectionGroup"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","kind":"symbol","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
