Apps like Instapaper changed the way we could consume news in a similar time shift. Instead of reading an entire article right when we happened upon it, we could save it to read later."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"The new freelance economy combined with teams spread across the world is introducing the time shifting of work. When I get my work done matters much less if you are in a time zone 12 hours behind. That opens up flexibility. Companies hiring freelancers also have to work around their schedules, at least a bit, because freelancers generally have to have more than one client and the companies hiring them know that."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Those changes lead to the question “when does work need to be done.” Does it have to be between 9 and 5? Absolutely not. Hopefully at some point in the near future companies will have to charge a premium to get work done during set hours as more people realize that things don’t have to be that way.","type":"text"}]}]}],"sections":[],"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/11-24-time-shifting-work","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"kind":"article","hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2015"]]},"schemaVersion":{"patch":0,"major":0,"minor":3},"metadata":{"platforms":[{"introducedAt":"2017.01.20","name":"Brunow"}],"modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}],"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"},"title":"Time Shifting Work"},"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/brunow","kind":"symbol","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
