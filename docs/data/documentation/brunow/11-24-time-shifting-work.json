Apps like Instapaper changed the way we could consume news in a similar time shift.

When I get my work done matters much less if you are in a time zone 12 hours behind. That opens up flexibility. Companies hiring freelancers also have to work around their schedules, at least a bit, because freelancers generally have to have more than one client and the companies hiring them know that.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"Those changes lead to the question “when does work need to be done.” Does it have to be between 9 and 5? Absolutely not. Hopefully at some point in the near future companies will have to charge a premium to get work done during set hours as more people realize that things don’t have to be that way.","type":"text"}]}]}],"metadata":{"modules":[{"name":"Brunow"}],"color":{"standardColorIdentifier":"purple"},"platforms":[{"name":"Brunow","introducedAt":"2017.01.20"}],"title":"Time Shifting Work"},"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/11-24-time-shifting-work","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/11-24-time-shifting-work"]}],"hierarchy":{"paths":[["doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2015"]]},"sections":[],"kind":"article","references":{"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2015":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2015","abstract":[],"kind":"article","title":"2015","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2015","role":"collectionGroup","type":"topic"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","title":"Brunow","role":"collection","abstract":[{"text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
