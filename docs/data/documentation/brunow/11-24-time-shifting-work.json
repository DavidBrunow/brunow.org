Apps like Instapaper changed the way we could consume news in a similar time shift. Instead of reading an entire article right when we happened upon it, we could save it to read later."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"The new freelance economy combined with teams spread across the world is introducing the time shifting of work. When I get my work done matters much less if you are in a time zone 12 hours behind. That opens up flexibility. Companies hiring freelancers also have to work around their schedules, at least a bit, because freelancers generally have to have more than one client and the companies hiring them know that.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Those changes lead to the question “when does work need to be done.” Does it have to be between 9 and 5?
