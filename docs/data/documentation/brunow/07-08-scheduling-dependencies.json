Adding another item doesn’t just affect this project but it ripples through everything else. But I don’t like the idea of telling a client that something isn’t in scope. It results in bad customer service, a tense relationship, and a worse project. Pushing every project back is the lesser of those two bad places to be.","type":"text"}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"I think the key is slack. Leaving more white space and free time in the calendar than you think you would need to. I’m not great at this because I want to say yes to everything, but I’m going to have to do it.
