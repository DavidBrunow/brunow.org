Adding another item doesn’t just affect this project but it ripples through everything else. But I don’t like the idea of telling a client that something isn’t in scope.

Leaving more white space and free time in the calendar than you think you would need to. I’m not great at this because I want to say yes to everything, but I’m going to have to do it.
