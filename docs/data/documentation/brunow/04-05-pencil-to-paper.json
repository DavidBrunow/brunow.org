I followed my normal podcasting routine — I poured myself a Scotch, sat down in the den, and started recording. I went through my usually intro. Then I sat there, not saying anything, for minutes.

I had to restart the recording before I could say anything.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"A similar thing happened this morning with this blog post.
