I followed my normal podcasting routine — I poured myself a Scotch, sat down in the den, and started recording. I went through my usually intro. Then I sat there, not saying anything, for minutes. About thirty seconds in ideas started coming into my mind but I sat frozen not wanting to break the silence. I couldn’t force myself to do it. I had to restart the recording before I could say anything."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"A similar thing happened this morning with this blog post.
