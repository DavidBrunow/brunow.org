About thirty seconds in ideas started coming into my mind but I sat frozen not wanting to break the silence. I couldn’t force myself to do it. I had to restart the recording before I could say anything."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"A similar thing happened this morning with this blog post.
