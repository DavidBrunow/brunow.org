I’m not excited for any particular thing that’s coming because I don’t know what’s coming. That surprise is helping to build my anticipation but more so I’m looking forward to the showmanship. In particular I’m looking forward to how the showmanship makes me feel. I’m looking forward to Apple leaders taking and commanding the stage and slowly revealing their story with perfect pacing building to new announcements. I’m looking forward to well-crafted videos that show great things being done with Apple products. I’m excited about the feeling that I’m part of something much bigger than me — the Apple developer community — and that we are all coming together for this one thing for this one week.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"People, even cynical software developers like me, want to be wowed.
