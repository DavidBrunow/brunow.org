For a long time that was because I didn’t know my product. One memorable example of that happened when I was selling used cars. I was on a test drive with a couple and the man asked if the moonroof had an auto-open feature. I didn’t know and said  that it did. And then he tried it. And I looked like a fool and my credibility was shot. That was embarrassing.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Now I have a very different problem — I’m afraid to sell things that I make. I don’t know if that sounds strange. I’m afraid to sell them for two reasons."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"First, I know they aren’t perfect. I know them so intimately that I know all of their flaws and limitations. I know that one of my apps is deeply flawed because it is an alarm clock app that you have to leave open all night long. I haven’t been able to look past that flaw to sell it."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"Second, I’m afraid. I’m afraid of someone not being happy with what I created and being angry at me for selling it to them. I’m afraid of the responsibility of taking someone’s money and the obligation that I feel that creates. I’m afraid of trying to sell something that I’ve put my heart into and the world not caring.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"It’s much easier to hide behind the idea that I’m an artist and not everyone will get what I make.
