For a long time that was because I didn’t know my product. One memorable example of that happened when I was selling used cars. I was on a test drive with a couple and the man asked if the moonroof had an auto-open feature. I didn’t know and said  that it did. And then he tried it. And I looked like a fool and my credibility was shot. That was embarrassing.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"Now I have a very different problem — I’m afraid to sell things that I make.
