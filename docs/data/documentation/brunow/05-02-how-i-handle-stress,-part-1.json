I hit some pretty low lows early in my adulthood and everything else seems easy. But that isn’t to say that stress doesn’t affect me because it definitely does, but my initial reaction is to get calmer when everyone else panics. Looking back over those times I see different situations that have to be handled differently.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"heading","anchor":"Putting-One-Foot-in-Front-of-the-Other","level":2,"text":"Putting One Foot in Front of the Other"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Many times you have no control over the source of the stress and no way to avoid it.

I had been laying in bed, reading The Art Of War before going to sleep. Then all I heard was a really big bang. Luckily, it wasn’t an explosion but just a rocket going through the outside wall of our building and bouncing off the walls of a room two down from mine. Then silence. I opened the door and peered into the hallway at the same time as everyone in the surrounding rooms and we saw the rocket rolling on the floor in the middle of the hallway.","type":"text"}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"We gathered downstairs while the bomb removal team took care of the rocket. I was severely shaken up. I had my arms wrapped around me — hugging myself — and my mind felt unstable. I don’t know a better way of explaining it than that. Then my mind came to a point where it examined the situation, weighed the options, and realized that I just had to carry on. I stuffed the experience down and locked it away.

I’ve endured long periods of this type of stress, and I think I was able to do so because I had the viewpoint of “that’s just the way it is.” Because things were out of my control, I was able to push them out of my mind and push myself forward. My recommendation is that if things are out of your control you should reconcile that early rather than wrestling with “if onlys” — if only I’d joined the Air Force instead of the Army, if only I were smarter, if only I wasn’t so bad at math."}],"type":"paragraph"}],"kind":"content"}],"identifier":{"url":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/05-02-how-i-handle-stress,-part-1","interfaceLanguage":"swift"},"variants":[{"traits":[{"interfaceLanguage":"swift"}],"paths":["\/documentation\/brunow\/05-02-how-i-handle-stress,-part-1"]}],"topicSectionsStyle":"detailedGrid","abstract":[{"text":"date: 2015-05-02T22:14:10-05:00","type":"text"}],"schemaVersion":{"patch":0,"major":0,"minor":3},"kind":"article","sections":[],"references":{"http://mobile.nytimes.com/blogs/takingnote/2015/03/24/kimmy-schmidts-revolutionary-approach-to-pain/":{"title":"Kimmy Schmidt says","type":"link","identifier":"http:\/\/mobile.nytimes.com\/blogs\/takingnote\/2015\/03\/24\/kimmy-schmidts-revolutionary-approach-to-pain\/","titleInlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"Kimmy Schmidt says"}],"url":"http:\/\/mobile.nytimes.com\/blogs\/takingnote\/2015\/03\/24\/kimmy-schmidts-revolutionary-approach-to-pain\/"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/Archive":{"url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/archive","kind":"article","role":"collectionGroup","title":"Archive","type":"topic","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/Archive","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"All posts"}]},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow/2015":{"identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow\/2015","abstract":[],"role":"collectionGroup","kind":"article","type":"topic","url":"\/documentation\/brunow\/2015","title":"2015"},"doc://Brunow/documentation/Brunow":{"type":"topic","role":"collection","identifier":"doc:\/\/Brunow\/documentation\/Brunow","abstract":[{"type":"text","text":"David Brunow, known as Brunow [ˈbɹunoʊ] to the folks he works with, is a human living on Earth.
