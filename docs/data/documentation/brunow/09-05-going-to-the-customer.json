I’m especially bad when dealing with people because I’m not good at it so I have to try extra hard and I don’t always have the energy for that. One assumption I’ve been making lately is that other people know my process for building things. This process is obvious to me, of course, so everyone else must know too, right?

Or at all."}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"So the point is that you can’t expect your customers to willingly go out of their way to research and learn everything about you and what you do.
