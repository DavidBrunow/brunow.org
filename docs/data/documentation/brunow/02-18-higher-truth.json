The ideas seem so foreign. For example, for much of my life I thought I could find the “higher truths” of life in music. I doubt I’m alone in this. I don’t know if it was because the music was popular that made me believe that the lyrics held so much meaning. Maybe it was the melancholy music that gave them a certain kind of gravity that I equated with meaning. Either way, I know I was searching for something and that search led to song lyrics.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"text":"I was reminded of this tonight by a Jack Johnson song. Don’t remember the name of it, but it is the one that goes “I used to think that maybe, pretty much means no” or something to that effect.
