The ideas seem so foreign. For example, for much of my life I thought I could find the “higher truths” of life in music. I doubt I’m alone in this. I don’t know if it was because the music was popular that made me believe that the lyrics held so much meaning. Maybe it was the melancholy music that gave them a certain kind of gravity that I equated with meaning. Either way, I know I was searching for something and that search led to song lyrics.","type":"text"}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"I was reminded of this tonight by a Jack Johnson song.
