We’d made it inside the shop and I was able to witness the epitome of taking your time. The barista did not seem to care the line was out the door. He didn’t care that people were waiting and irritated. He slowly measured the espresso, carefully tamped it down and gently spun the tamper, and he made sure he was making the best cup of coffee he could."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"That memory is at least a few years old but it had an impact on me.
