He didn’t care that people were waiting and irritated. He slowly measured the espresso, carefully tamped it down and gently spun the tamper, and he made sure he was making the best cup of coffee he could."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"That memory is at least a few years old but it had an impact on me.
