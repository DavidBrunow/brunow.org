One of the most difficult things for me is finding a consistent rhythm. I doubt I’m alone in this as life is unpredictable.

My thought is that mornings are for doing things — for action. Shortly after you get up will be when your mind and body are least tired and they should perform at their best. My plan is to not waste that energy on consuming information or relaxing physical activity like deep stretches. Those can wait until the evening when my energy is spent."}],"type":"paragraph"},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"I don’t know how long this routine will stick.
