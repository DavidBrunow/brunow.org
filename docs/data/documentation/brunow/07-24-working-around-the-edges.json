You have to work around the edges of what that child can do and keep expanding those edges.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"paragraph","inlineContent":[{"type":"text","text":"This is true of all kids, but it matters much more if a child has a disability that doesn’t allow them to be as resilient as a child without any."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"Today I was thinking about how well that advice works in other parts of our lives.
