It doesn’t lose its amazing qualities, we just get used to them. So many things about this world are amazing that it can be overwhelming. I’m tempted to say “we should slow everything down”, thinking that we need time to absorb what we have already.

As they grow older, these events become less frequent and when our kids are mature they nearly cease."}]},{"inlineContent":[{"text":"We see this in new technology too.
