title: 2014 Year in Review
---
2014 will be known as the year of exhaustion. I've been wore out and sleep deprived for years but this year tops them all.

Overall, my state of affairs is positive.

## Work - Score: Neutral
Work has taken over my life, sucking the time and energy out of almost everything else I do. Not wanting to compromise, I have still tried to have a life outside of work and that has pulled me even farther.

The year started out with two projects needing bailouts in January, another in the spring (maybe March or April?) and another in July. Each of these bail outs meant sleepless nights clacking away at the keyboard to balance multiple projects while not giving the wrong people the impression that things had gone wrong. I hate that situation. In future years I'm going to do everything I can to avoid it, starting with being 100% honest as soon as something doesn't go to plan. I've tried to play Superman too many times and it just isn't maintainable.

In addition to the bailouts I've pushed two software development projects and a .NET framework upgrade through to completion in the last six months. Now I'm wrapping up a third project that I took over about half way through. Fortunately, all this work means tons of learning. I've come up with a way of architecting JavaScript applications that I really like. I've also learned C# and I am using MVC.NET and Angular.js on this current application.

As our company grew this year I got my first experience working together on a software team and I got to learn a lot about good systems to have in place for that team. I setup source control, issue tracking, time tracking, project tracking, a wiki, and team chat systems and got to see each work in the real world.

Halfway through this year I took a position as the Vice President of Technology and added managing the team to my list of responsibilities. Again I found myself in the position of managing people and just like last time it wasn't a good fit.

## Family & Friends - Score: Positive

## Home - Score: Positive

## Personal Projects - Score: Negative

## Spirituality - Score: Positive

## Health - Score: Negative

## Finances - Score: Positive
I've made some real progress on my debt, paying off two credit cards. I now have around $25,000 in unsecured debt but most of that is student loans. Depending on job prospects over the first half of next year I may be able to finish paying off credit card debt.
