title: Snow Falling
---
I am a sensitive, emotional soul.

I feel largely at the mercy of my emotions. I ride epic highs and apathetic lows in the ocean of my moods.

At the crest of a wave, I am light and springy. Flitting and bouncing with the currents of life.

Every day, little hurts fall from the sky. Not intentional, but painful. Life. Pain from missing my daughter, worry over whether I will have enough hours to pay off some more debt, fear that the world will not accept the new thing that I poured myself into and created.

But I have responded this way to pain before my daughter was born. The pain of something mean my dad said to me, the pain of not being accepted, the pain of failure.

Each by itself is nothing. But I let them accumulate.[1] As they do, they weigh me down. I become snappy and irritable. I become apathetic but with a profound sadness. Numb.

Then I fall down. I break and it all falls way. And I'm light and springy again.

[1]: "I've tried a number of different things to stop the accumulation, but haven't found one that works quite yet. I got the idea once that I should mourn the bigger sadnesses in my life as they occurred, like Brad Pitt's character in _Snatch_ did. So every other Sunday night I would get piss drunk. Didn't seem to work the way I wanted. Now I'm trying something new. Writing about my pain and exposing my fragile soul to the entire world."
