Howdy!

I'm David Brunow and software is my art.

I want to make software that probably wouldn't be able to make money. I know what you're thinking -- but David, if it can't make money then that means the market believes it shouldn't exist and the market knows best! And you might be right. But I believe that the world needs more great software in niche areas and for craftspeople that can't pay hundreds of dollars for specialty software to help them do their job better.

This idea already exists in radio and television -- Sesame Street wouldn't exist without it. I want to apply that sort of philosophy to software. Software supported by the people for the people.

I'd love your support. I can't tell you right now exactly what software I will create with your funding, but I can make some promises about it:

* I will make it open source
* I will make it free, unless there are maintenance costs associated with the software (such as leasing a server in a data center or licensing rights to an idea from a book) and then I may charge a fee to cover those costs
* I will let you know what software I have in the pipeline and take your suggestions, although I may not use any of them

I've already created one of these types of apps with my Dharma Talks app and I will continue to create them whether you decide to fund me or not. The difference will be the difference I can make and the good I can do working on these full time rather than when I find the time.

In anticipation of the question I would ask -- why me? Why support David Brunow to make this software?

I am not the greatest software developer in the world, or even in North Texas. I don't claim to have any brilliant ideas that are going to set the world on fire. But I do care. I care about the little folk whose lives can be improved with software in tiny ways, incrementally. I cannot promise breakthroughs or revolutions but I will push us all forward if just a little bit.

Thank you for your attention.

David
