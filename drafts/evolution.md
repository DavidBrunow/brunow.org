title: Evolution
---
The classic laymans view of evolution is that it is the survival of the fittest. This idea is used by many of the fittest in society to excuse themselves from harming their fellow man (CAN I FIND CITATIONS?). I propose another view -- evolution is the survival of the organism that fits the best in the entire ecosystem. Other organisms may form through mutation but they will not survive long term.

Can I find scientific evidence of this take on evolution?
