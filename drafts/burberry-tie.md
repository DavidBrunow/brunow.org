title: Burberry Tie
---
She draped the Burberry tie over my pillow. She got me the tie as a graduation gift and it was quite my style -- thin with a subtle pattern.

That was the night I told her I was leaving. She was about 7 months pregnant with our only child. Two months earlier we had learned our daughter had something wrong. That news destroyed my world.

Every time I picture that tie laying on that pillow it stabs my heart the same way it did the first. The way she intended.

I wear it now as atonement. Punishing myself with pain, guilt and remorse from hurting someone I care about so dearly.
