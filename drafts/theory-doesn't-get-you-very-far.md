title: Theory Will Not Get You Very Far
---
Computer science education in universities is mostly about the theory. It is about the ideas related to computing and how computers can work. Theory doesn't get bogged down in specific languages or bug tracking or version control. Theory doesn't tell you about specific implementations of databases although you may learn some algorithms for storing and finding data quickly.

Theory doesn't help when you have a real world problem. The world is a specific implementation of a theory which has hundreds or thousands of its own nuances.

This doesn't just apply to computer science at universities.

If you read a book on woodworking you'll know the theory behind how to make a cabinet, but you won't know how to hit a nail without splitting the wood or what to do if you drive a screw out the other side of your board.
