title: Busy
---
I'm really busy all the time. I never feel like I have time to get to everything that I want to and I always feel behind where I want to be. Maybe it is because I want to do too many things. Maybe it is because I'm not good at estimating how long any of those things will take.

But really, I'm only as busy as I let myself be.
