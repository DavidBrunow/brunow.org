title: Feeling It Out
---
Are you good at navigating a room in the dark? I find that it comes pretty naturally to me. I gauge where I think things should be, and then start feeling for the edges of them. By feeling the edges, I can figure out what that thing is.

I think this is a good metaphor for how I learn things, and a helpful way to avoid frustration when learning something new. When you don't understand, you aren't stupid but you just haven't found the edges yet.
