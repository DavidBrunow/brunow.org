title: Criticizing Versus Complaining
---
In a similar vein to my post about [surrounding yourself with positive influences](), what energy are you putting out into the world?

The most negative energy that I encounter on a daily basis is complaining. Complaining is useless. That isn't to say that you shouldn't ever say anything negative. Instead, say negative things after doing research and coming up with a potential solution. To me, that is the difference between criticizing and complaining.

Criticism is highly valuable.
