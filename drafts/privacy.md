title: Privacy

Here is my privacy policy that applies to all current and future applications I create. You can find a copy of this policy at http://brunow.org/privacy 

    Your data is always owned by you, even when 
    an app that I have created collects that 
    data for you. When I store your data in a
    system that I own or control I will provide
    a way for you to export that data.

    Since you own your data you will decide how
    I will be able to use it and I will ask your
    permission before collecting it. I will
    limit asking for and using data that has 
    personally identifying information to times
    when I really need it -- like when I am
    troubleshooting a problem you are having 
    with my software. Most data collection, with
    your permission, will be to collect data in
    aggregate and will not include any 
    identifying information.    

    I will never share your data with 
    advertisers.
