title: What's the Right Amount?
---
I've never been very good at knowing when to quit. Whether it be quit eating ice cream so I don't get sick or quit working so I don't get burnt out. I'm very good at ignoring what my body is telling me. This lack of feedback makes it difficult for me to avoid overwork so I'm trying to put systems in place to prevent it. Just like I don't keep ice cream in the house because I will definitely eat it.

As I recently wrote, my big battle right now is with overwork. I have identified the problem and now I am trying to figure out how to prevent it.

First, I am putting rules in place for myself:

* no working when my daughter is staying with me
* absolutely no over nighters 
* no working past 10pm

These rules will definitely help, but there is still tons of room for killing myself. The other thing I need in addition to these rules is a healthy relationship with work.

Currently my relationship with work is filled with guilt and fear. Guilt that I'm not doing enough and fear that I'm lazy. Voices crowd my head when I think about this topic, saying "that's a nice first world problem to have, at least you have food on the table" and "everyone that makes as much as you make works more than forty hours a week."

What do I say to those voices? What do I listen to, my body or my mind?

When I listen to my body, it tells me I am done somewhere between 30 and 35 hours a week. I'm the type that works intensely, going at 100% and at that intensity I just won't last as long. Fortunately, I have found (another source)[http://www.alternet.org/story/154518/why_we_have_to_go_back_to_a_40-hour_work_week_to_keep_our_sanity] that validates my body's feedback:

    ...research shows that knowledge workers actually have fewer good hours in a day than manual laborers do â€” on average, about six hours, as opposed to eight.

But realistically, how can I work that few hours a week? Especially in the consulting industry which is 100% driven by billable hours. For certain, I can't in this industry-- if I want to work any reasonable number of hours I'll have to either leave consulting entirely or start my own consulting company that doesn't have a maniacal focus on hours billed.

There's also the other side of the equation -- my bad habits that keep landing me in the same situation. I am awful at saying no. I think it is because I feel like I need a reasonable, rational explanation for why I'm saying no. I don't feel like "I can't do it" is enough. Also, I love new challenges and the image of myself as "the guy that gets it done." I've made some progress since I am able to identify these bad habits-- now I need to change them.
