title: About Shepherd Dog
---
Shepherd Dog is the team of my girlfriend and me -- Brandy Thomas and David Brunow. We both have a diverse business background and we are both able to quickly learn new businesses.

Most recently we have worked with a large international company in the hospitality industry building custom software.

We are in the consulting business to see other businesses succeed and that drives our different  approach to taking on clients. We choose our clients rather than our clients choosing us. We find companies that we really like but we believe could use a little help and then we market ourselves to that company.

## Things We Do


## Things We Don't Do

* Search Engine Optimization (SEO) -- We strongly believe that the way to get traffic to your site is to have highly relevant content. The way you get a high Google ranking is to have something that people want to see. Have something useful or remarkable and you will get good page rankings.
