title: Is It Denial?
---
Sometimes I look at my daughter and see her disabilities. I see her difficulty with crawling and walking and the way her eyes don't usually focus on me. I see her problems and for a moment I don't see the rest I know is there. The rest of her depth of personality and character. I see only her obsession with Elmo and Elmo's orange nose. I hate myself a little when I look at her like that, but I think it's useful to examine.

Am I in denial when I believe that my daughter can become anything? When I believe that she will be just as smart as her Daddy and have an ear for music like her Mommy? I do think I am.

But I think that's the only way to approach this situation. I see no good that comes from seeing the worst side of things.
