title: What Kind of Neighbor Do You Want
---
As we settle into our new home in Denton, Texas, I am learning as much as I can about the community. I've started following a couple of City Council candidates on Twitter and I've read the blog posts as position statements from Amber Briggle, one of the two women running for the seat in our district. I found myself agreeing with her position on most items, but found one that I opposed strongly. It was [this one about how beneficial Tetra Pak is to Denton](http://www.votebriggle.com/news/tetrapak).

Shortly after reading it we went on our daily walk. During most of it I was deep in thought about why I disagreed so strongly. And I thought about how I would decide my opinion on the topic -- what criteria could I use to make my decision.

I think the main reason I disagreed is that I have a visceral reaction against big corporations. I've been thinking about why that is and I'll be talking about that in detail in another post. In short, I've examined some of my behaviors and my feelings toward big corporations must be more nuanced than "I hate them all."

What I want to focus on here is the question that I came up with for whether I would want a particular big corporation to come to Denton, and the follow up questions that come along with it.

That question is "What kind of neighbor do I want?" Why that question? Because our community is the way it is because of the people in it. And those people all our neighbors. So if my neighbor changes then our community changes just a bit. And with enough change our community will no longer be recognizable, for better or worse. To me, the most basic unit of that is what kind of neighbor I want. Here are my answers to that question.

I want a neighbor that works locally. Long commutes are proven to reduce quality of life and to add pollutants to our environment. I want my neighbor to have the highest possible quality of life and not have to drive to Dallas to find work that pays the bills.

I want diversity in my neighbors. Diversity has been proven to improve communities. I want to see all kinds of diversity: race, gender, sexual orientation, political and religious views, and whatever else may come.

I want a neighbor that finds her work fulfilling. Again, I want a high quality of life for my neighbor.

I want a neighbor that is well paid for what she does. Again, I want a high quality of life for my neighbor.

Given these answers, I can better evaluate a big corporation coming to Denton with simple questions:

* What is this company's record for hiring locally?
* How well does this company cultivate diversity?
* How fulfilling are the jobs this company is bringing?
* How well does this company pay their employees overall -- are they above or below average across the board?

So how does Tetra Pak measure against these questions?

* How well does this company cultivate diversity? At first glance, not well. Their board of directors has one female out of six total board members. All the members appear to be white. The nine person management team is 100% white males. Their annual report doesn't use the word "diversity" even once, although one of the subsidiaries of Tetra Laval (the parent company of Tetra Pak), includes it as part of one of their values.
