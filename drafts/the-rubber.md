title: The Rubber
---
The idiom "where he rubber meets the road" gets thrown around a lot. I'm not a huge fan of idioms because they're a lazy way to talk. But I was thinking about this one tonight and came up with a slightly different meaning better suited to what we do as people that solve technology problems.

I looked at three different sources for definitions of this idiom and got three different answers. My interpretation has been that the saying means the point where things happen and consequences are faced.
