I've been listening to the early episode of [The Web Ahead][linkWebAhead] and I am caught off guard by how foreign the idea of responsive design is to the host, Jen Simmons. Obviously, I am coming from a perspective 2 years in the future, so my perspective is skewed to some unknown degree, but I believe there is more to it.

I think that responsive design is foreign to designers because they are used to dealing with things that are static. Further, I think that it 'clicks' more with me as a developer, because developers are used to dealing with things that change.
