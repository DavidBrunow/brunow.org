title: Who Do I Want To Talk To?
---
Can I control the type of people who read my writing? I think I can -- I write things that that type of person finds interesting.

If I assume that I can control that then I must make a decision -- who am I writing this for. I think that by default I am writing for people like me -- if I find something interesting then it is safe to assume that someone like me would find it interesting as well.
