title: SEO
---
SEO, an initialism for Search Engine Optimization, is such a dirty word for me. It brings to mind nothing but scammers and sleazy marketers. When we were first deciding what services we were going to provide I was determined to include something about how we don't do SEO -- that we believe that good content will naturally surface so we we put our efforts into good content instead of SEO.

Most of that is still what we believe -- the focus on good content is the most important thing you can do. Focusing on the user rather than Google's bots is our top priority.

But recent events have changed our minds a bit about SEO. We needed plumbing work done at our house to replace the hot water heater which had been leaking for long enough for our floors to be squishy. Our neighbor recommended a local company and we are thrilled with his work and service. It was one of the best experiences I've had dealing with a service company. And yet this company was invisible to Google.

If I search for "Denton plumber" his site is on page 11 of the search results -- virtually invisible. We talked with him about it and it turns out he was working with a company that promised top listing in Google. One of those good for nothing companies that have SEO that bad reputation.

This made us angry. We can't stand good people getting taken advantage of. Especially when it is using technology -- and people's fear of technology -- against themselves.

So we will be providing SEO services. In addition to building our clients the most user friendly, useful content-laden site possible we will also be following Google's and other search engines best practices. We will be monitoring the metrics that matter.

We aren't sure what form it will take but we will be sharing what we learn with the world. Hopefully that will help small business owners who want to take control of their own SEO to do it a little better.
