title: Working Back From The Final Product
---
It is easy to look at something someone created and believe it was inevitable -- that this is the only way it could be. But I don't believe that. Changing just one small factor in the process could have changed everything. Nothing is inevitable, everything just is what it is.

This phone has a group of creators. What if one of them were sick for three weeks during its creation? Would it still be the same?

I think we tend to have a bias towards thinking the things that exist do so for a reason. We think that they are the best option that could survive and that they are the fittest. It is easy to ignore the effect that time has on everything and that everything is changing. It is easy to ignore the random chance that affects everything in this world.
