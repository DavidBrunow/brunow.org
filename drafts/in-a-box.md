title: In A Box
---
I'm not sure why but I find that I regularly put my skill set in a box. I feel like I'm out of my element if I'm doing something that isn't in that box. I've never had formal training in an area or had some outside entity verify my skills. So I don't believe in them.

I'm finding lately that I'm the only one limiting myself in this way -- the people I work with are not putting me in that box. They want to see me succeed and solve their problems across a wide range of situations. 

I have the skills, understanding, and motivation. I don't need to artificially limit myself.
