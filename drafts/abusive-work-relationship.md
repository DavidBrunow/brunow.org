title: Abusive Work Relationship

A year ago today was my first day of freedom after four years. Three weeks before, I'd given my notice, with no alternative lined up. But getting out of there, I was more than OK with that.

Most days were not bad, although there was always a little bit of unease when in the office. For the short four years that I'd been there, I'd had a lot of different positions, some of them directly in the line of fire, and some quite removed. But nowhere was really safe.

Yes, it sounds like I am exaggerating a bit. It wasn't like I was dodging bullets, or having rockets being shot at me. But minimizing situations where you are on edge emotionally just makes the situation worse.

All of the problems came from one person. That person would yell at you if he thought you made a mistake, ..., and make you get up and dance at quarterly corporate events.
