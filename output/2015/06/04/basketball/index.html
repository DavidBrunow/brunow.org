<div class="post-content">
<p>I started playing basketball in the 9th grade and I wasn&rsquo;t very good. I had no coordination and could barely dribble and run at the same time. I couldn&rsquo;t make a layup.</p>
<p>I kept working and kept getting better but throughout most of my years I sat on the bench. I think part of the reason for that was my typical way of wanting to define my own thing rather than play in someone else&rsquo;s system &ndash; I was tall and wanted to play outside and our high school coach wanted a big tall guy to play near the basket all the time.</p>
<p>But the other part was that I wasn&rsquo;t outstanding at what I did. I didn&rsquo;t even know what would make me outstanding &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t have that concept in my head. I could shoot from the outside really well but I couldn&rsquo;t dribble the ball great so it was easy for little guys to take it from me and I&rsquo;d get out of breath easily (although that was a problem our entire team had).</p>
<p>If I could go back and coach myself I&rsquo;d make myself do the things I didn&rsquo;t like more of the time. I&rsquo;d have made myself run every day and constantly practice dribbling. Only then would I let myself practice the fun part of shooting.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d teach myself that I can improve in areas that I don&rsquo;t like by just sticking with them every day. I&rsquo;d build the confidence that I could out run, out shoot, and out dribble anyone. And I&rsquo;d be good enough that it wouldn&rsquo;t matter what system the high school coach had &ndash; he&rsquo;d have to take notice and if he wanted to win he&rsquo;d have to play me.</p>
