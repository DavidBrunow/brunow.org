</header>
<div class="post-content">
<p>For the past while &ndash; months at least, maybe a year &ndash; I&rsquo;ve been struggling
with an idea. The idea is small and I&rsquo;ve spent a disproportionate amount of
time thinking about it.</p>
<p>I know that diversity of ideas and opinions in a work team is a good thing.
<a href="http://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/better_decisions_through_diversity">Research shows this.</a> Despite this knowledge, I was getting very
frustrated by some of the ideas of my team members that conflicted with my own.
I didn&rsquo;t understand how a good thing could be affecting me that way. My rational
mind was telling me &ldquo;It is good to have this kind of diversity, it balances out
the team. Your strength in this area will balance out a similar weakness in
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a number of lengthy conversations with friends about this topic and I
kept coming back to the idea that some diversity of ideas is good and some is
bad<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. I just couldn&rsquo;t figure out the distinction between the bad and good.</p>
<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve figured it out: Values. My definition of Values is ideas that mean something important to a person.</p>
<p>If I split my ideas and opinions into two categories, Values and Everything Else, then my internal conflict makes sense. I can give myself a pass for not
giving in on my Values<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. I&rsquo;ll give some examples.</p>
<p>First, an idea that isn&rsquo;t a Value, at least for me. &ldquo;High Fructose Corn Syrup
is an awful invention that is making our world more unhealthy.&rdquo; I fully believe
that idea, but I won&rsquo;t feel frustrated if someone I know drinks a Coke. Here&rsquo;s 
another, &ldquo;The Mac OS is far more stable and powerful than the Windows OS.&rdquo; I
definitely agree with this, but I don&rsquo;t grind my teeth every time I walk by
someone running Windows 8.</p>
<p>Now, an idea that is a strong Value for me. &ldquo;The point of making things is to
help other people, not to make money.&rdquo; This idea resonates with me. Working in
an environment with an atmosphere filled with views to the contrary leads to 
frustration. I am not a good fit for that environment.</p>
<p>So what are my Values? I don&rsquo;t know them all, but here are a handful:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The point of making things is to help other people, not to make money</li>
  <li>The best way to get more work is to deliver high quality work</li>
  <li>Spend as much as you can on high quality tools</li>
  <li>Be happy to pay for things</li>
  <li>Ideas alone are worthless</li>
  <li>The right technique or strategy does not deliver high quality work &ndash; doing
the hard work does</li>
  <li>Every being in this world is connected, and everything you do changes
another&rsquo;s life either for better or worse</li>
  <li>You cannot compartmentalize your life or your mind</li>
  <li>What you repeatedly do you will repeatedly do</li>
  <li>You cannot multitask and the one thing you are doing right now deserves your
full attention</li>
  <li>Software should be designed for the user, not for the programmer</li>
</ul>
<p>have different Values than I do. I am saying that a difference of Values between the people you see every day causes problems.</p>
<div class="footnotes">

    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>My statement that &ldquo;some diversity is good and some is bad&rdquo; is highly context-dependent. I am definitely not saying that no one in this world should <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>Not giving in on Values still does not make it OK to be a bigot. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
