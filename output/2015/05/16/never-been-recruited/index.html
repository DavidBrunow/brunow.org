<div class="post-content">
<p>Throughout my work life I have worked many different jobs and excelled at most of them. I&rsquo;m a team player with a strong diverse skill set and very strong work ethic. However, I&rsquo;ve never had someone try to recruit me to a specific position. Even when I joined the Army, I went to the recruiter and said I wanted to sign up.</p>
<p>Sometimes my ego hurts a bit because of it, but in general I know I&rsquo;m good at what I do so I don&rsquo;t worry about it too much. I do wonder about the dynamics of it though &ndash; the whys of &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I get recruited?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why does this person get recruited?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know in at least one situation that my friend thought I was too good for the place she worked and so she would never recommend me for it. That&rsquo;s certainly flattering in a way but a pain when I am out of work. Does my skill set preclude me from some jobs because I&rsquo;m overqualified? Probably.</p>
<p>I think another factor that weighs in this is that I haven&rsquo;t been in one particular industry for more than five years and am rarely in any one position more than 18 months. I keep moving up or sideways through companies and then onto the next challenge. That doesn&rsquo;t make it easy for anyone to classify me in any particular field.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also always been part of a small team or been the only person on the team. The best way to be able to recommend and recruit someone is to have worked with them before and I just haven&rsquo;t worked with as many people as anyone who has worked on large teams.</p>
<p>So are these all just excuses? I don&rsquo;t know. Have you ever recruited anyone to work for or with you? What factors influenced your decision to do so?</p>
<p>Either way, I&rsquo;m happy about where it has led me, into doing my own thing.</p>
