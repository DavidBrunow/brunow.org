</header>
<div class="post-content">
<p>Two and a half weeks ago I wrote about <a href="http://brunow.org/2015/03/19/starting-a-meditation-habit/">starting a meditation habit every morning</a>. Since then, I&rsquo;ve only broken the habit once when I meditated in the afternoon instead of the morning. I&rsquo;ve changed it so that it is the first thing I do instead of doing it at the vague time of &ldquo;sometime in the morning&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Around the same time I made a rule for myself that I&rsquo;m not allowed to use electronics in bed. I still use my phone for an alarm clock, but beyond that I don&rsquo;t use it. I had an awful habit of laying in bed and reading email, Twitter, and my RSS feed before summoning the energy to move. I&rsquo;d spend a half hour just laying there.</p>
<p>Changing these two things in my morning has had a dramatic impact on how I feel about the day. I have a purpose each morning, something that is easy for any of us to forget, but especially impactful when you work for yourself.</p>
<p>I also noticed that my favorite mornings were the ones when I had one of the sessions from the Stanford iOS 8 class waiting to be watched. I would get a little bit giddy and excited before going to bed the night before. Apparently I really enjoy and look forward to learning.</p>
<p>In a strange coincidence, two weeks ago my mom gave me a book called &ldquo;<a href="http://miraclemorning.com">The Miracle Morning</a>&rdquo;. I put it aside because I&rsquo;m reading a couple other books right now, but I picked it up two days ago when she asked if I&rsquo;d read it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not too far into it yet &ndash; I wanted to write this before I read the whole thing and subconsciously stole all its ideas, but what I&rsquo;ve seen so far is similar to this routine I&rsquo;ve begun. The author, Hal Elrod, talks about how important the first hour of your day is for setting up the rest of it. If you spend the first hour of every day with a purpose and bettering yourself then those actions will spill over into the rest of your day. If you have a morning routine that you look forward to in the mornings then you will excitedly get out of bed instead of laying there as long as you can convince yourself to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I can recommend the book yet because it feels awfully &ldquo;self-helpy&rdquo; with all of the marks of that genre &ndash; promising everyone that with just one little secret they can get rich and be in shape, etc.</p>
<p>But I really like the ideas from the book that I&rsquo;ve shared here and I&rsquo;m going to continue to experiment with them. I&rsquo;ll continue my meditation habit, find something to learn every day, do my daily writing, and possibly throw in exercise. I&rsquo;ll write more soon about how that goes.</p>
