</header>
<div class="post-content">
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently realized that I&rsquo;m not good at two things that I want to be good at &ndash; writing and podcasting. I&rsquo;ve been posting on my blog irregularly but those postings haven&rsquo;t been enough for me to &ldquo;find my voice&rdquo;. I either feel like I am a stuffy, boring version of myself or like I am imitating writers I admire.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also just started my path towards podcasting and after only a few minutes of trying to record myself without stumbling I am very humbled. Listening to great podcasts makes it all seem so natural.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s great that I&rsquo;ve found things that I am not good at and that I feel very uncomfortable with both. I have a lot of room to grow.</p>
<p>I will only get better by doing them often. I&rsquo;ll start with writing &ndash; I&rsquo;m going to <a href="http://yourturnchallenge.strikingly.com/">take the challenge</a> and ship for 7 days straight. I really think that in the long term every day may be too often to have a blog post since I tend to skip over the long daily blog posts that I subscribe to, but for a week it will be good.</p>
<p>After that challenge I&rsquo;ll work on podcasting. Maybe just by recording my thoughts about something every day at first but at some point I need to ship that too.</p>
<p>While writing this I&rsquo;ve asked myself &ldquo;why do you want to be better at these two things.&rdquo; I hadn&rsquo;t asked myself that question before writing this so there is my first reason. Trying to communicate an idea to someone else makes you question it in ways that you don&rsquo;t usually do in your internal mental dialog and both of these mediums stimulate those questions.</p>
<p>The second reason is that we have very limited ways of transferring information from one to another and I want to get better at all of them. I believe that our biggest limitation as a species is the difficulties we face transferring complex knowledge and I hope to find better ways of doing it.</p>
