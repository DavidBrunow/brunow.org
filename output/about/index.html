</header>
<p>David Brunow defies classification. Throughout his life he has taken on many
different types of roles and excelled at most of them (he wasn&rsquo;t very good at
being a used car salesman). Lately, he has been consulting and building software
for a large international company and building iOS apps. Before that, he held
several different roles in a community bank: Audit Assistant, Compliance
Officer, Bank Secrecy Act Officer, Assistant Vice President, Junior Executive
Officer, Operations Manager, and Systems Administrator.</p>
<p>Each role has increased David&rsquo;s expertise. From his time as a Compliance
Officer, he knows the language of regulatory documents and can read and
understand how regulations affect all kinds of businesses. From his time as a
Systems Administrator and through various side projects, he knows much about the
hardware side of the technology world like servers, email, and mobile devices.
From his time as a software developer and other various side projects, he knows
all the parts of web and mobile programming. From his time as a Generator
Mechanic and soldier in the United States Army he knows discipline and how to
read schematics.</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s most valuable asset is that he has learned a framework for figuring out
new things. New problems are always coming up, driven by changes in technology,
regulation, and everything else in our world. David has repeatedly shown that he
can solve those problems.</p>
<p>David has a Bachelors of Science in Business Computer Information Systems from
the University of North Texas.</p>
<p>David recently started a small business with his girlfriend Brandy Thomas called
Shepherd Dog. Shepherd Dog builds software tools for small
businesses and non-profits in the Denton, Texas area.</p>

<p>David loves his <a href="http://EmmaCan.com">daughter</a>.</p>
