<div class="post-content">
<p>Today I&rsquo;ll continue the discussion I started yesterday about that moment after I&rsquo;ve had an idea that I think is great. In that moment I ask myself &ldquo;Why hasn&rsquo;t this been done before?&rdquo; One answer to that question is &ldquo;Actually, it has been done before but it failed&rdquo; so I&rsquo;ll discuss how I handle that possibility. I think it&rsquo;s important that I note here that I&rsquo;m asking this question to determine whether I can turn my idea into a sustainable project and business. If you only care about making something you are fired up about then this question won&rsquo;t matter to you.</p>
<p>The keys to handling this situation are research and finding root causes. I need to learn as much as possible about the previous attempts to do this thing. From that research I need to put together the facts to figure out why it failed. Most businesses fail because they run out of money but that isn&rsquo;t helpful information here. I need to know <em>why</em> they ran out of money. I&rsquo;ll also be tempted to blame the incompetence of the people who were trying to do this the first time. I&rsquo;ll tell myself that I won&rsquo;t be so dumb and make the mistakes they did. But again, that isn&rsquo;t the root cause and, as a side note, I will make incompetent mistakes too although they may be different ones.</p>
<p>Ultimately the root cause should fall into one of two broad categories &ndash; the previous effort either went in unprepared, with too little cash or experience or talent or all three, or their target market didn&rsquo;t care about their thing as much as they anticipated. After finding one of those root causes I have to ask myself &ldquo;can I bring somethings to this that will avoid that problem?&rdquo; Hopefully the answer is yes. Then that is the beginning of the slog to actually follow through and prove it.</p>
