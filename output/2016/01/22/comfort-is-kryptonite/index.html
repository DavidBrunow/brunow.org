<div class="post-content">
<p>I found a <a href="http://macklemore.com">video announcement for the new Macklemore and Ryan Lewis album</a> last night and immediately loved it. I have a soft spot for people being honest and real. I don&rsquo;t know whether or not that was manufactured for this announcement but it convinced me. I enjoyed the whole thing, but this line near the beginning stood out the most to me:</p>
<pre><code>Being comfortable is what kills artists.
</code></pre>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been comfortable in years although it generally hasn&rsquo;t been by choice. Every time I thought I&rsquo;d found comfort life kicked it out from under me. Now I see that as a good thing.</p>
<p>Comfort is different than success. You can be highly successful and still have an itch that keeps you uncomfortable. The key is finding which discomfort is right for you.</p>
<p>Seth Godin said something similar on a podcast. I don&rsquo;t remember which one or his exact words, but he said something to the effect of a discomfort that was bad for him was worrying about finances. As I said yesterday, your results may vary and you need to find what works for you. So Seth made sure he was comfortable in that area so he could push himself out of comfort elsewhere.</p>
<p>Which brings up an important point. Comfort isn&rsquo;t Kryptonite that your nemesis uses on you. It is self-inflicted exposure. You can choose to be comfortable and therefore weaken your super powers. Or you can choose to push out of your comfort and become stronger every day.</p>
