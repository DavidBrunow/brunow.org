<div class="post-content">
<p>A year ago, my daughter started <a href="http://brunow.org/2013/05/07/shes-seizing/">seizing in the back seat of my car</a>.</p>
<p>Since that day she drinks a syrupy medicine twice a day and I carry a shot of
Diazepam with me wherever we go. If she starts seizing again, I&rsquo;ve been
instructed to call 911 and watch the clock. If she seizes for five minutes then
I inject the Diazepam in her rear.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she hasn&rsquo;t started seizing again. From what I see, the seizure has
had no adverse effect on her. Obviously, it is not possible to know what she
would be like if she hadn&rsquo;t had the seizure &ndash; but her curiosity and awareness
of the world grows daily. She teaches me children&rsquo;s songs and I teach her
Beatles songs.</p>
<p>The past year hasn&rsquo;t been about major breakthroughs &ndash; its about hundreds of
incremental improvements. I am happy to say that Emma is really becoming
herself. Now she is three and we can start to see her personality &ndash; hints of
who she will be.</p>
<p>Emma started school a few months ago and has picked up some wonderful bad habits
from the other kids. My favorite is when she doesn&rsquo;t get her way and starts fake
crying &ndash; the crying lasts for about five seconds and then she puts both hands
on her nose, whinily saying &ldquo;Nose&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll have to get some video of it.</p>
<p>The part of that that really makes me happy is that she wants to get her way.
That means something to me &ndash; that means that she knows what is going on
around her.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll share another thing she loves. I&rsquo;m not a big fan of singing songs in the
traditional manner every single time, that gets boring. So I&rsquo;ll change the tempo
of a song like &ldquo;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&rdquo; when I sing it with Emma &ndash;
changing it from &ldquo;Twin-kle Twin-kle, Lit-tle Star&rdquo; to &ldquo;Tweeeeeeeeeeenkle, 
Tweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeenkle, Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit-tle Staaaaaaaaar&rdquo;. She
absolutely adores it. Every time she sees me she grabs my mouth and starts
singing it that way to me. She is also very quick to adapt. If I change the
tempo in a different way then she will do the same.</p>
<p>These incremental improvements don&rsquo;t lend themselves to my concept for <a href="http://EmmaCan.com">her site</a>.
My intention there was always to show the major milestones and the big ways that
she overcomes expectations. Because of that, I haven&rsquo;t posted anything about her
progress in a long time. I fear that may make anyone who has heard her story
think she isn&rsquo;t making progress or that she hasn&rsquo;t recovered from her seizure.</p>
<p>So going forward, in addition to the major milestones, I will be doing &ldquo;State of
the Emma&rdquo; posts there, to share all the little things that turn into something
big when put together. I hope to have one out soon.</p>
<p>Thank you for caring about Emma.</p>
