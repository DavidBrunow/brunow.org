title: If I'm Marco
---
If I'm Marco Arment and I dislike the way [bugs in the iOS Framework are being
handled by Apple][linkMA], here's what I'll do.

I'll buy a domain name. pre-radar.com and pre-radar.org are both available. I'll
probably go ahead and get both.

Then I'll build a site. Some sort of community site, probably something similar
to Stack Overflow with reputation and badges. The site will allow developers to
submit their code, which they believe is buggy due to the frameworks, for peer
review. Since I have a large influence in the iOS Development Community, I can
convince the best of the best developers to have a look at the code.

This peer review process will solve problems. First, it will get rid of many
bad bug reports being filed to Apple, because someone would point out the error
in the developer's code that isn't in the framework. Second, it would strengthen
the reputation of pre-radar.com in the eyes of the community and in the eyes of
Apple. Apple would be able to trust reports filed from the community. Third, it
would build a combined voice that single tweets and angry blog posts cannot
match -- here are the bugs that we have found and verified: fix them.

By doing this, I also solve another big complaint about the current system --
lack of transparency. The entire community can see everything submitted, and
other developers can vote "me too" about bugs, after submitting their own code
that shows the same behaviour.

I know, I know -- Apple should do this. It is their responsibility to fix their
system. But I'm a part of that system. And if I can make it better, why won't I?
