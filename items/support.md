The quickest ways to contact me for support is to tweet at me [@davidbrunow][linkTwitterDavidBrunow]
or to email me at [helloDavid@brunow.org][linkEmailAddressDavidBrunow].

I'm also experimenting with another way of chatting about the software I've
created which is [my Discourse forum][linkDiscourseForum]. I'd prefer this
method to talk about issues so that anyone that has the same problem in the
future can check there first to see if they can find their answer.
