title: Hot and Fresh
---
You'll have to forgive me because I'm a nerd a I've never really understood the more socially driven aspects of life. Things like fashionable clothes or hip slang escape me -- I just don't get it. Why would you intentionally say something in a less direct and more obscure way? How will anyone understand you?

I had an epiphany a couple days ago. I think I've finally understood the point of some of things. I finally see the value in knowing what the hot, fresh thing is.

But I still can't put it into words.
