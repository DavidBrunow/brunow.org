title: A Tip For Mixers

Have you ever been to a mixer? A social event where you are supposed to mingle, meet, and make connections? I've been to a few and I've never been a fan. But that's because I didn't know the right way to do them.

So what's the right way, you ask?

Get a drink and find a place to sit. Not alone, have at least one other person with you. But sit. People will come to you. And it won't be the usual people, it will be people you're less likely to talk to regularly.

Try it next time you have to go to a mixer. Let me know how it goes.
