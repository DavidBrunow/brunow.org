title: April Daily Learning
---
I've started a new habit of daily learning. I spend a half hour to an hour every day taking an online learning course. This last month, I've taken courses from [CodeSchool](http://www.codeschool.com) and the [Stanford How To Start a Startup course on iTunes U](http://startupclass.samaltman.com). I'm keeping track of what I cover each day so I can look back at how far I've come and to put peer pressure on all of you to do something similar. :)
