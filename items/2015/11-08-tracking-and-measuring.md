title: Tracking And Measuring
---
Are people successful because they track and measure things or in spite of it? The most successful people have more than talent, they care immensely about what they are doing and want to know every detail about what is going on. So they track things as a symptom of that desire for knowledge.

I believe the success comes from the caring, not the tracking.
