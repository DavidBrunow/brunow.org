title: Sitting And Thinking
---
Sometimes it is a little uncomfortable for me to sit still and think about something. Different parts of my mind chime in with thoughts like "you don't have time for this right now" or "what if you don't think of anything and this time right now is just wasted?"

These thoughts just went through my head a couple of minutes ago. I'm sitting in my car, waiting to go into a meeting. I have nothing meaningful to do (I've already been through my Twitter feed and email a few times and read everything in my RSS feed) and yet these thoughts still come up when I sit here for 30 seconds to think about what to write about today.

Thankfully, this time these thoughts were the inspiration for what to write. Most days, they are discomfort that I have to fight through.
