title: October Daily Learning
---
I've fallen out of a few habits lately and my daily learning is one of them. I've started a Coursera on what plants know but I haven't gotten very far into it. I think the main cause of falling out of this habit is that I've had a backlog of work to do, but I think another part of it is that I don't have anything that I'm really interested in learning lined up. The machine learning course that I'm in the middle of was wearing me out.

This coming month I'm going to try to get back in a few habits that I've gotten out of. That just seems to be part of the cyclical nature of life, habits rise and habits fall.
