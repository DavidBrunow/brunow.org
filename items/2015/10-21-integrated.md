Small teams that know each other well are the best at creating integrated, cohesive, and great things. Each member has to be able to understand what the others are saying or feel comfortable asking for clarification if not. Each member has to be able to tell any of the others when she is doing something wrong and she also has to be willing to accept that criticism.
