title: Beyond Repair
---
It is easy to come to the conclusion that something is beyond repair. It may be saddening or even depressing, but it is easy. Because to say that something is beyond repair is to stop. It is giving up and coming to terms.

Another option is to keep hope alive -- to keep fighting. This option is similar to living in denial and I'm not sure that there is a difference between ignoring information you don't want to believe and keeping up hope. I think they may go hand in hand.

But when I'm thinking about life and living beings, I always keep up hope. We're far more resilient than we give ourselves credit for and we can recover from nearly everything.
