title: Thoughts Stuck on Repeat
---
We all have thousands of thoughts that go through our head each day, most of which are repeats of the day prior. Most are harmless and superficial, but some are deeply ingrained stories that we've been telling ourselves for years. They've become a part of who we are whether we still want them there or not.

I recently recognized one of these thought patterns. The best I can describe it is that I have a way of blaming myself when things don't go well even though it is completely out of my control. I get this sense of inadequacy, that I don't belong, and that I don't deserve to be where I am at, doing the things I'm doing. I feel like I'm just not good enough.

These little thoughts whisper to me throughout the day, usually without notice. They feel outside of my control like they are just part of the landscape. But now I'm aware of them.

Prompted by ideas in the book "[The Miracle Morning](http://miraclemorning.com)" which I talked about in a [post the other day](http://brunow.org/2015/04/04/my-morning-routine/), I'm working to replace these ideas. I'm doing that through affirmations, which feel really silly. But now that I've recognized those little thoughts that are telling me things that aren't true, I can see how affirmations work. It is simply a way to replace your default daily thoughts with upgraded ones of your choosing.

Today is the first day I've tried using an affirmation so I have no real data on whether they work. But they cost nothing, can cause no harm, and have an enormous upside. And in just one day I noticed a difference -- my affirmation was randomly on repeat in my head throughout the day. I felt more positive than I have in a long time.

Try it as part of your morning routine. Repeat something positive about yourself out loud. I did it 5 times in a row but I don't know if that's the right number. Let me know how it goes.
