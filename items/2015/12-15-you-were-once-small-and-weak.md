title: You Were Once Small And Weak
---
You were once small and weak. Your tiny hand could only wrap around my thumb. You did not know this world.

Now you are bigger and stronger but not the biggest or strongest. Your small hands look tiny next to mine but give an excellent fist bump -- we're still working on the explosion. E-X-P-L-O-S-I-O-N. This world has been tough and in a short time you've been through a lot. You've learned from me and I've learned from you. Middle C. You know more about this world now and you still great every day with a smile.

Some days you simply have to let out what you feel.
