title: Wanting Things To Be Different
---
As the Buddhist saying goes, our discomfort comes from wanting things to be different than they are. So when you feel that way, how do you want things to be? Can you work on getting there? Or do you simply need to acknowledge that this is one of many discomforts you will feel in life and you just have to deal with it?

I find that simply asking myself the question eases the discomfort. I'll be working and not enjoying it much and I ask myself what I'd rather be doing. I'd rather be napping. Well, you can't do that right now. Ok then. I can move on and focus less on the discomfort.
