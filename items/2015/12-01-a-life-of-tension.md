title: A Life Of Tension
---
I always want my life to be calmer and less stressful. I also always want to be creating things and making an impact on the world. These two desires are constantly in conflict and create tension. I feel the same tension between knowing I need to execute on projects in the future and therefore need to wait on them and the desire to do them right now. That tension between patience and impatience drives me forward and a little bit crazy.

Is there a way that I can create the way I want to without the tension? I doubt it. I think tension is a necessary part of creativity.
