title: Showing Respect
---
Showing respect when discussing ideas with others requires more than simply giving them a chance to talk. It requires actually listening to what they have to say. It requires doing research ahead of time to ensure that you know what you're talking about and you aren't just wasting their time. It requires an effort to really do your best to see where they are coming from and to see the world from their point of view.

No ones point of view is crazy or ridiculous. Each of us has our reasons for believing what we do, and if you had lived the same life as that crazy or ridiculous person then you'd feel the same way they do.

Showing respect to others is showing respect to yourself -- we are all the same.
