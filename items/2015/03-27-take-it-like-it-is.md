title: Take It Like It Is
---
We have so much control over our world today and it is tempting to make it exactly how we want it. To order the food we like without the mushrooms we know we don't like. To stay inside in our nice comfortable homes. To think about our nice comfortable world views. Taking in what we want.

I'd like to make the case for allowing serendipitous events to unfold. Order something the way it comes, or add something to it you've never tried. Get outside in the cold and feel it to your bones. Read things that you don't agree with or talk with people who have different points of view.

Doing these things will both make you grow as an individual and appreciate the things you like even more. More importantly, they open you up to possibilities you can't imagine in your perfectly controlled world.
