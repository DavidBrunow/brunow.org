Do you feel like no one appreciates your true value at work?

It could be that you greatly overestimate your contributions. But more likely, you're delivering too much -- giving too much of yourself and providing value that isn't being asked for.

But that's a good thing -- a very good thing -- although it can cause discomfort and heartache for you. You've outgrown your job and it is time to move on. If you don't get going you will either lose your will to deliver to your standards or get so angry that you burn bridges.

If I'm right and you're as good as you think you are, it's that time. Figure out the next step.
