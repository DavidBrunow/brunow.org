title: June Daily Learning
---
I didn't do a great job of keeping track of my daily learning in June, but it was all about WWDC. Once a year, Apple hosts a conference called WWDC for their developers where they teach them about the new technologies that are being introduced and how to improve their use of the existing technologies.

Apple provides all of its videos online for free  and in June I watched 23 of those videos. I'm not even half way done with them so most of July will be the same.
