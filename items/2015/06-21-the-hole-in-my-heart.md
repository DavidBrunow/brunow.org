title: The Hole in my Heart
---
Nothing can fill the hole in my heart from saying goodbye to my daughter for another three days. Nothing can make it easier.

All I can do is appreciate the time with her and remember her fondly when she's not around.

Father's Day, and every other day, I love and miss you Emma.
