title: Downtown Denton Art Show
---
We went to an art show today in Downtown Denton and it was such a cool experience and I can't even put my finger on why it was. Maybe because it takes a special kind of place to make time for art these days. Art is the opposite of efficiency and maximizing profits. A community that fosters art is one that knows that it must invest in more than just the rational and defendable decisions. It must invest in beauty and things that touch us deeply.
