title: Nothing Meaningful Happens in a Week
---
Diets, exercise routines, meditation habits, and marketing campaigns all take time. It's tempting to evaluate progress on them after a week. It seems like the most reasonable time period --longer than a day but shorter than a month -- and a week feels like forever when you have to exercise your discipline repeatedly to do something unpleasant. Or when you are waiting on the outcome of something new you've tried to get customers to call you.

The chemistry of your body does not change in a week. Your mind will not be noticeably calmer. Customers won't be beating down your door.

Meaningful change takes time. At least a month, sometimes more. Resist the temptation to give up.
