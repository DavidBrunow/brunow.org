title: Getting Caught Up
---
For months, maybe a year or more, I've felt like I'm way behind on getting the things done that I want to. Recently I was able to complete something that I've been trying to get to for about a year and released new versions of a couple of my apps.

I feel like a burden has been lifted. I still have plenty I want to do, I've just recently started two more side projects and have a few in mind after those, but those are future projects rather than past projects -- ones whose deadlines have already come and gone.

I know all of it is in my head, but time and again I feel the same way. I feel great if I'm ahead and poor when I'm behind.
