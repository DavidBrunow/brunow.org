title: Looking Backwards
---
Looking backwards you can connect the dots in any way your mind chooses. You can create a story and to you that story can be very real. Your story can have evil forces conspiring against you or it could have angels protecting you.

Neither is likely to be true. The people in your life most likely spend a very small percentage of time thinking about you, let alone working for or against you.
