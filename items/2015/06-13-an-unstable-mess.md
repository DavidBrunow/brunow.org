title: An Unstable Mess
---
For about four months of the year I willingly choose to subject myself to what I refer to as "Beta Season." This is the time of year following Apple's annual developer's conference when I install the newest versions of Apple's operating systems on the devices that I use every day. Devices I use to get my job done.

The best part of this time of the year is not the cool new toys or showing off to people that I'm special and they aren't, although those are great. The best part is seeing how unstable and unusable software from one of the best software companies in the world can be.

Seeing this lets me know that Apple puts a ton of effort into making good software. It doesn't come easily and they don't magically write bug free code. They put in the work over several months to make their code run nearly flawlessly. Knowing this inspires me to put similar work into what I do and to persevere when getting it right seems insurmountable.
