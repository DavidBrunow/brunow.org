title: A Bumpy Landing
---
We just came back from San Francisco and our flight was delayed due to bad weather in Dallas. Fortunately, by the time our plane got here the weather had mostly passed but it was still pretty windy and bumpy during our descent.

Four plane rides over the last week have helped me become more comfortable with being uncomfortable in those kinds of situations. I feel I've really made progress in letting go of those things I can't control.

This last flight I realized that while I knew I couldn't control the bumpy ride I still tried to control my physiological response. I tried to control my nervousness and sweaty palms.

Once I realized that I let it go too. Instead of trying to control it I sat with it and felt how it felt. It wasn't comfortable but it wasn't really uncomfortable either. It was simply what I was feeling at that moment. Nothing more.
