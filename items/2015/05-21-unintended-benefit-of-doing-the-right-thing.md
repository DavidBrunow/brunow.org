title: Unintended Benefit of Doing the Right Thing
---
I don't break the speed limit, I don't cross a busy street without a walk signal, I follow the rules when I ride my bike, and I have complex work around the house done by professionals. I generally try to do things or get things done the right way. Some of that is the rigidity of my personality -- as I've posted here before I like rules to remove ambiguity. But there is another benefit -- peace of mind.

I don't have to worry about getting pulled over for speeding or being at fault if I get hit by a car or my water heater exploding because I installed it wrong or any number of the other things that I choose to do right instead of cutting corners. That peace of mind isn't about having the moral high ground, it is about eliminating fear because fear is something that can keep us from being our best selves.
