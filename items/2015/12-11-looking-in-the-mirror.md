title: Looking In The Mirror
---
I have a bad habit when I look in the mirror, especially when I'm not wearing a shirt. I contort my body in ways that make me like what I see from the angle I'm looking because I'm not happy with what I see.

I'm not happy with my weakened body which has withered from too much time at a computer and not enough time moving. I'm not happy with the way my head hangs forward and makes me feel like a hunchback.

So I almost reflexively change what I see. I adjust for a moment and then move on with my life a fall right back to where I was. I do the same thing over and over. In those areas I am stuck.
