title: Dependence
---
Facebook has had a few outages lately. This isn't something I'd normally write about because it is topical, and if rather write about things that aren't quite as time dependent, and because it is about Facebook, which I really don't like. But my point is broader than these outages.

If your business relies on Facebook then you are dependent. When Facebook goes down you go down, and there is nothing you can do to fix the situation. This dependence comes with some really nice upsides -- Facebook is a reliable platform that is easier to use than most content management systems and can do most of what a small business needs in a website.

But that dependence is always something I consider when making a technology system. Many times, the benefits are worth some level of dependence.
