title: Making Something Great
---
I have a new hypothesis. I believe that the only thing you need to make something great is the will to make it. If you have that will then you will be able to power through any obstacles.

I have a couple of ways I'll be testing this, and I'd love to see if it works for you. I will be starting projects that are completely outside what I do today and see if I can make them great.

Greatness takes time, so I'll report back later.
