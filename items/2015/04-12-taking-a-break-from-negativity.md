title: Taking A Break From Negativity
---
A few weeks ago I reached a moment where I became completely weighed down by some negativity surrounding me. I was being too heavily influenced by people who seem to get their kicks by kicking other people. I've been telling myself that their point of view can be helpful, that they can make me think in different ways so I should accept their input.

But I was completely weighed down. How was I supposed to keep going? I needed a break and I took one and it made a huge difference. 

I didn't let that negativity near me for a while. During this while I've tried to figure out if the ability to think in different ways due to their opposing points of view is worth the negativity. I don't think it is. The negativity pulls you down too much.

My advice is to let it go if there is any way you can.
