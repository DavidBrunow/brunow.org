title: The Name You've Given It
---
Have you given your problem a name? If so, are you still working to solve the problem or do you simply mention it in passing?

Take scoliosis for example -- a curvature of the spine. Scoliosis is not a thing -- it is a name we've given to a thing. You don't treat scoliosis, because it isn't a thing. You also don't ignore it simply because it has a name -- "yeah I have bad posture because I have scoliosis." You treat the underlying problem. You find a way to re-balance your body to remove the curvature.

What's your scoliosis in life? Are you ignoring it now that it has a name?
