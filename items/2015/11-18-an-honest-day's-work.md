title: An Honest Day's Work
---
I'm not sure if things have changed since I haven't been around long enough. And I don't know if my point of view is skewed by the people I surround myself with. But I feel like the concept of getting paid for an honest day's work has fallen aside, instead, everyone is looking to maximize their ROI, hoping for big payouts, and trying to live the 4 hour workweek.

I don't like it. I'm stubborn and a little old fashioned and I want to make an honest wage for the work I've done and the value I deliver.
