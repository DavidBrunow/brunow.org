title: An Educated Opinion
---
The only way to have an educated opinion about a topic is to immerse yourself in it. TV shows and movies glorify a fake type of leader who makes decisions with little to no information just going by her gut. What they do show is the days, weeks, months, and years that that person spent being surrounded by their problems.

Don't rush to make a decision. Sit with it, spend some time with it, and allow yourself time to think.
