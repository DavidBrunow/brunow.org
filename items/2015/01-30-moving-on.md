title: Moving On
---
Today I left the company I've been working at for the last three years. This last year was brutal -- many sleepless nights of work, 50+ hour weeks, little to no exercise, and projects that just kept dragging on.

I found my breaking point. I'm whooped.

I'm thankful for the environment I worked in that was flexible enough for me to decide on the technologies to use and to learn. I'm thankful to have met and worked with many wonderful people. I'm thankful that I have the opportunity to decide what is next for me.
