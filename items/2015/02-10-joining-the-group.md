title: Joining The Group
---
I'm working to figure out what groups I want to join. Who do I want to be associated with and whose company do I want to enjoy. Who gets my precious time and attention?

I feel as though answers to these questions should be simple but they aren't to me. If I spend time with group A will group B or group C exclude me? Do things work that way or can I find a way to float effortlessly between groups, enjoying the company of all the members of all the groups? Is this all just silly overthinking?

This conversation in my head reminds me of Jesus hanging out with those that society called sinners. He spent time with those he could help the most. Maybe that's the way to go.
