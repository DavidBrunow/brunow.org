title: Not Being Connected
---
Today we drove to Colorado and we are staying in a camper on a piece of land in the mountains. This place is remote and has no power, water, or cell phone connectivity.

It wasn't until I was here in this place what it is like to not be connected. Before leaving, I didn't even think to tell my friends and family that I'd be in reachable because the very idea of being unreachable is so foreign to me.

None of my devices work for the things I usually use them for. My phone can take down this blog post as a note, but it can't get my email or tell me what the weather will be like later today. My watch can tell me the time and track my movement and heart rate, but it can't tell me when the sunset is going to be.

I don't think that being disconnected is bad, but it is very different. And will require some more planning ahead next time.
