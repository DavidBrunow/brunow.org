title: Connections
---
Connecting with others requires a caring that leads to learning about others, a shared language, and common ground. The good news is that the simplest connections are easy -- we can easily choose to care about the person walking down the street past us and communicate with shared smiles on the common ground of being human.

Deep connections take time. It is much more difficult to care about something over a long period. Words fail to express even the mundane parts of the day to day, serving as a poor form of communication. Body language and tone of voice are powerful aids but much of the time they can further confuse the message. The strongest common ground is similar experiences, the best of which are shared.
