title: Do Real People Care
---
Being a technology nerd I surround myself with technology news and have technology need friends. That makes it hard to stay in touch with what real people value in technology.

For example, I know that real people -- not just technology nerd people -- care about their phone's battery life. But I didn't think that they knew enough about how their phone works to know that certain apps will use more battery than others. Today I downloaded the Snapchat app and saw the first two reviews both complained about it:

This is awesome. I love that people are holding developers accountable to better performance.
