title: Building Trust by Giving Trust

One of the quickest ways you can erode my trust is by asking me to sign something at the wrong time. Like an NDA before you discuss a project with me or a contract in a situation where a friendly handshake would do.

My policy is when in doubt, trust. You trusting me will make me trust you more. A positive cycle.
