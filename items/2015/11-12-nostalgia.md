Today was a good day. I remembered some old times, got recognized for old sacrifices, and enjoyed time with friends.

The remembering was more emotional than I expected. It pulled up memories that had feelings tied to them that I'd left far in the back of my mind. I miss every moment that came before this, both good and bad. I grieve their passing.
