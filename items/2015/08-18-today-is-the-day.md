title: Today Is The Day
---
Inspired by [Seth Godin's post today](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2015/08/the-interim-strategy.html), today is the day to start doing things the right way. Today is the day to start making long term decisions instead of putting out fires. Today is the day to start changing the world.

I find myself falling into the "not today" trap most often when it comes to taking my time to make sure things are really great instead of stopping when they are functional. I tell myself that I'll do that when I'm successful or when I don't have to worry about money as much or when I have fewer projects going.

That day won't come because the "not today" trap is inside me. It is my fear putting it all out there and my fear of success. I can only change it by repeatedly doing things differently, overcoming the bad habits and putting new patterns into place.

Today is the day.
