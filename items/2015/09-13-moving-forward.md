title: Moving Forward
---
Those of us at the front have to push forward faster than we'd like. We know that not everyone will keep up. We know that some things we do will be lost along the way.

But the only way to keep our momentum is to keep pushing forward as quickly as we can. It is uncomfortable. It feels too fast. Our minds struggle to keep up at times. But we must endure that to move us all ahead.
