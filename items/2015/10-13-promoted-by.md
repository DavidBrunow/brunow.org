title: Promoted By
---
I don't want to see ads in my social media. They are poorly targeted and get in the way of what I want to see. Most of the ads on Pinterest, for example, are completely different than the rest of the items that have been recommended to me. They stand out because they are misplaced.

Whenever I do like something I see in my Pinterest feed I habitually check to see if it has been promoted. If it has I make a quick face of disgust and move on.

I don't want to see the things that a brand thinks are cool. I want to see the things that other humans think are cool, or even the things that the recommendation algorithms think are cool. Anything but a company paying to show me things.

The digital world should be a place that allows your customers to share what you make more easily. Make something remarkable and people will remark about it and share it.
