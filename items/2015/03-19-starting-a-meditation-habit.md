title: Starting a Meditation Habit
---
Yesterday I started developing a new morning habit of meditation. I'm keeping it simple so I'll stick with it. I sit somewhere for 5 minutes with my eyes closed and try to focus on my breath while letting other thoughts pass through my mind. I set an alarm on my phone so I know when 5 minutes are up. I find that setting a strict amount of time is critical to actually following through with a habit consistently. Any ambiguity will quickly pull a new habit apart.
