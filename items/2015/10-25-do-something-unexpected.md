title: Do Something Unexpected
---
We are fortunate to have friends that revel in spontaneity. Today they invited us to go up to Oklahoma for a day trip to check out a casino. After a very full day, we are exhausted but satisfied. It was good to get out of our normal rhythm and spend time with some of our favorite people.

How long has it been since you've done something similar? Are you due for it.
