title: You Will Get Overwhelmed
---
Today I was listening to a [podcast about coffee](https://overcast.fm/+DvTEgSnzo). The two hosts, who classify themselves as coffee enthusiasts, we're giving tips directed to people just getting started in the world of coffee. They remembered what they went through and advised those new to the world of coffee to not get overwhelmed.

Immediately I knew their advice is universal. The road to coffee enthusiast is similar to the road to technology enthusiast or musician or painter or software developer. You start at a point of knowing nothing and you are immersed in knowledge.

I'd give slightly different advice than they did. My message is "you will get overwhelmed." It is natural. Everyone does. It gets better. Pay attention to how you feel and take a step back once you start to feel overwhelmed. Give yourself some time to soak in the knowledge. Then pour another bucket on your head.
