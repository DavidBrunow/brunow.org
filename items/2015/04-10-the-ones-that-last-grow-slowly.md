title: The Ones That Last Grow Slowly
---
Had a great conversation this morning about a new exciting project that is far too young to talk about yet. But the topic of trees came up at one point and the person we were meeting with has a lot of knowledge about trees. He said something along the lines of "The trees you want are the ones that grow slowly -- they are the ones that last."

Real change, the change that lasts, grows slowly. Be patient. Put in the hard work. Take your time. Good things will come in their time.
