title: You've Got To Look Out For Each Other
---
The most memorable advice that I've received from my mom is "you've got to look out for each other."

My sister and I are close in age with me being just 15 months older than she is. Due to that we seemed to be always getting in each other's way which caused lots of picking at each other and fighting. The worst time that I remember vividly is that I knocked her to the ground by pushing her while tripping her from behind. (Sorry Laura!) While yelling at me, my mom shared her advice.

Sometime around then -- this was 20 years ago so the order of events is fuzzy at best -- my sister was being picked on by a kid that took the same route home from the bus stop. One day -- let's pretend it was the next day after my mom gave me the advice, you know, for dramatic effect -- I stuck up for Laura and told the kid to stop. He got off his bike and got up in my face. Probably said something clich√© like "what are you going to do about it?" So I threw my textbook at him, hitting him square in the chest. He left, and left her alone after that.

That incident reinforced my mom's advice and it has become a strong part of who I am. But this advice extends past my sister and me. We all have to look out for each other. We all have to make sure we take care of those around us.
