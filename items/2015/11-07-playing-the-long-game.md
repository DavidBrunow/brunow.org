title: Playing The Long Game
---
While making every decision in our business we try to choose the path that we believe will lead to long term success over any that will only lead to short term success. We call this playing the long game.

An example is our pricing policy -- we have chosen to always provide a written estimate up front and never charge more than that estimated amount. Plus, we only charge for the actual hours worked if we do manage to come in under our estimate.

That policy has meant that we had lost out on a good amount of money in the short term. But we believe that we will build a higher level of trust with our clients which, along with excellent service, will mean that they will do everything they can to work with us long into the future. We're playing the long game.

What does it take to play the long game? Generosity, patience, vision, and resources to get you through the ramp up.
