title: Making Things Is Painful
---
I'm in the depths of creating an app right now and I'm not having fun. I'm fighting with mental data hierarchies and workflows and wrangling pixels and spending far too much time in my head. I feel disconnected from the real world. Parts of me want to surrender and admit that I'm  not good enough, that I'm a fraud.

The work I do isn't hard. I sit at a desk and type and think. But I want this process to be fun. Lollipops and sunshine all the time. 

That's just not the way it works. Sometimes doing what you like doing sucks. I cannot stand feeling the way that I feel right now. 

I'm sure I've written these same words before but I don't think I can write them enough. Most people will stop here. The voices in their head will win out and they will find something less painful. 

Don't stop here. Push through, persevere. The pain is temporary.
