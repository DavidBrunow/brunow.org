title: Adapting Taste
---
Some time back I made a significant effort to reduce sugar and salt from my diet. I stopped putting sweetener into my coffee and stopped eating fried food and other food that had been preserved in salt.

As a result, I can taste much subtler levels of sweet and salt in my food. I also get overwhelmed much more easily by the saltiness of fast food or over-sweetening coffee.

We have this awesome ability to adapt to situations and after very little time we don't even remember that we adapted. Every once in a while we have to force ourselves to question out adaptations.
