title: Nothing Quite Like Novel Enthusiasm
---
Today I spent a couple of hours at the Startup Weekend event here in Denton in a role of mentor/coach. Can't say that I contributed very much in that short amount of time, but I did get a chance to talk to a few people and see some cool projects.

But the main thing that stood out to me was how excited people were to be working on their projects. Their enthusiasm was ebullient and contagious. Working in the tech industry every day with some fantastically cool technologies makes me a little numb to how cool it is to be able to do what I get to do every day.

It was a refreshing experience that I highly recommend.
