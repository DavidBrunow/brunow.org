title: Quitting When It Is Just Not Working
---
I just stopped working on a different draft of a blog post. I was trying to make a point by tying a couple of ideas together and it wasn't going well. I kept wondering where I was trying to go with my point and failing to figure it out.

Right now I don't know whether the entire concept of the post was bad or if my brain isn't working well enough to put it together. I'll be able to tell that with time, maybe tomorrow or maybe in a few weeks. For now, I'm setting it aside because I know it is just not working.
