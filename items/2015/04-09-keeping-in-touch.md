title: Keeping in Touch
---
I've met many great people in my life, each of which has a special place in my heart. Unfortunately, life demands mean that it is easy to lose touch with those people -- anyone that isn't in your life every single day is easy to lose in the blur of daily life.

I've started a new weekly thing where I send a message to 2 people I haven't talked to in a while. The message contents depend on the person, but generally I just say something like "We haven't spoken in a while and you were on my mind so I wanted to say 'Hi!' I hope things are going well for you."

I'm loving the results. You should try it too.
