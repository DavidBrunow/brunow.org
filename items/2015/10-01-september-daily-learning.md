After 3 and a half months I've finally finished watching all the WWDC videos that I wanted to watch. Now I'm back to the machine learning course where I'm just trying to keep up with the math. I sure hope something more practical comes up in it soon because watching a man write formulas on a chalkboard from his notes doesn't feel like it is doing me a lot of good.

Today I took a break and started watching something different that I am really enjoying. It is a talk from Horace Dediu about markets, S curves of adoption, and disruption. I highly recommend you watch [the video](http://youtu.be/Mk4Ov7WXm_w).
