title: Getting Lost In The Process
---
I have a problem when I create things that you might have to. I sometimes get lost in the process of creating something -- making sure I'm using proper grammar the entire time I'm writing my first draft or trying to use the perfect architecture while creating the first version of an app.

The problem is that I lose momentum and energy while doing this. Instead of putting my creative energy towards the talks at hand -- creating a blog post or software -- I'm putting that energy towards thinking about what I'm doing. That creates quite a bit of drag.

As I write this though, I wonder if all that thinking is simply a symptom of needing more experience. Perhaps these things will start to come to mind naturally the more I practice.

I kind of hope so and I kind of hope not. I'd hate to think that I have all the answers and can simply rely on what I've done before. That sounds boring. Maybe that's my problem.
