title: Appropriate Self Promotion

Here's my rule about self promotion: I can only do it when I've made something new for my audience that I think they will enjoy or when I'm meeting a new audience that I think will enjoy things I've made.

Anything else is spam.

I liken it to whispering in a crowded, noisy room -- I'm picturing a dinner party from one of the Batman movies right now. Most people will not hear you or ignore you but the ones that care about what you have to say will listen harder and pay more attention.

The scary thing about this is that it's possible that no one cares right now. In my mind, the worst thing you can do in that case is repeatedly pick up the bullhorn and interrupt everyone's good time.
