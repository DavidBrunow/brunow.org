title: Pest Control

Today we had an exterminator come and treat our yard with pesticides. Our dog has been attacked by fleas for a few weeks now and only putting medicine on him didn't do any good -- more fleas would just jump on him the next time he went outside.

I don't like killing living creatures. This was a tough decision for me, do I kill these thousands of tiny creatures to make my life and my dog's life better? I did. I mourn their deaths.
