title: Sharing Your Values
---
Every action you take is a chance to share your values.

Unfortunately not everyone has the privilege to be able to make every choice based on her values. She has to make a certain amount of money to be able to afford goods that are made by people paid a fair wage. She has to be in the right part of the country to be able to buy locally and in season.

But there are choices that we can all make. I value life so I do my best not to kill anything. That doesn't cost me a thing.

So do what you can and don't be too hard on yourself, but put thought into it. It matters.
