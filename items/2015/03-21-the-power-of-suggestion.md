title: The Power of Suggestion
---
This idea is so obvious now I don't know why I haven't thought of it before. It's an idea for how to get going when you're in a funk and just don't feel like doing something that you really know you want to do.

We humans are highly suggestible. When I watch basketball I want to play basketball because it reminds me of how much I like it. Same with watching video games, people building software, and people creating video.

I'm going to try to implement a system now for those times when I really don't want to do what I know I want to do. I'm going to watch a few minutes of video of someone else doing it first.
