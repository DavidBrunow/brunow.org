title: Sharing Your Talents
---
One of my biggest pet peeves is when people have been given a remarkable talent, like being able to sing well for instance, and they don't share it with the world. Instead, they hide behind their fear and keep it to themselves and those close to them.

I believe that if you have that kind of talent then it is your responsibility to share it with the world. And we live in an awesome time when sharing has never been easier.

Stop being selfish and share.
