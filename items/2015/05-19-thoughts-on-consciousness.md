title: Thoughts on Consciousness
---
A huge cloud of consciousness floats over the land, loosely connected but all the same.

Drops fall from it and land on the ground just long enough to claim their individuality before returning to the nearest stream and joining their brothers and sisters, moving forward together and usually unaware of their bonds. Unaware that they are the same.

They follow the course of the stream, sometimes hopping out as random events push things this way and that. They continue to the ocean, each following their own specific path.

At the end of the journey they evaporate and become part of the larger cloud of consciousness again. Once again remembering that they are all one, if they forgot.
