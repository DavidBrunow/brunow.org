title: Privileged
---
I've led a privileged life and I know it, although I will never know the full impact. I know enough to say that a large reason why I've been successful is because I'm a tall, good looking, white man. Because of those qualities alone I've been given opportunities that others wouldn't have been given. And mentioning those traits ignores the facts that both of my parents are college graduates, that I was born in one of the richest countries in the world, and that I have full use of my body and mind.

I know I've worked hard in my life, but I've also been very fortunate.

I'm not saying that you've experienced privileges like mine and I'm not saying that I've worked harder than you -- but I'd encourage you to take some time to think about your life and the times that fortune has smiled on you. Take a step back from your ego. Put your accomplishments into perspective.

With that mindset, how can you help someone less privileged than you? Maybe you can give them a voice. Maybe you can give them a chance. Maybe you can stick up for them when the world wants to beat them down. I'm not sure exactly what you can do -- I'm still trying to figure that out myself. But I'm starting with knowing that I've been given advantages in this life that not everyone has.
