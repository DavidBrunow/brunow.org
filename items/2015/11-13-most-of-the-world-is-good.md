title: Most Of The World Is Good
---
After tragic events it becomes difficult to remember that most of this world is good. Our natural reaction is to amplify the way we see the suffering in the world. Our brain fails us as we go into a defensive mode. A mode where everyone who isn't exactly like us is our enemy.

But most of the world is good. Even in the parts of the world that aren't like ours, most of the people are good, just like most of us are. They live their life the same way we do ours, doing the best they can to make their world a better place.
