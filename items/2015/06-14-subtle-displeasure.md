title: Subtle Displeasure
---
I've recently decided to stop using an Internet service that I've been using for years and I'm amazed at how joyful I feel about leaving that service. I'm amazed because I didn't even know that I was displeased with the service so this joy came out of nowhere.

Thinking about it more, the service has rough edges that irritate me just a little bit every time I use it, like a slow and buggy mobile client and a mediocre desktop client. These tiny irritations have been adding up in the back of my mind.

My takeaway from this is to ask myself what else I can take away that could bring this kind of joy? What other ways can I simplify my life?
