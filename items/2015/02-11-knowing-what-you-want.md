title: Knowing What You Want
---
It takes time to figure out what you want. Before you have, you will borrow what other people want and what society wants and you will believe that is what you want too.

For the longest time I thought I wanted to be rich. And with our lottery-minded society I thought it was just a matter of being in the right place at the right time. I thought I didn't have to do much work and I'd just be carried along.

That was about 15 years ago and I've been through much more life. I've tried wanting what other people want (and everything that comes with that) a couple more times at least and it has lead to unhappiness.

So I hope I'm right now -- I hope I've figured part of myself out and can craft the life I want out of that.
