title: A New Way To Interact
---
Apple recently introduced an interaction model they call 3D Touch that acts as a sort of shortcut to common interactions. You can press a little harder on an email preview to see more of the message. You can press a little harder on the phone icon to quickly call one of your favorites.

T-Mobile has a new interaction model for customer service using Twitter. They use the Twitter API to connect your account to your Twitter handle and verify who you are. Once they do that they can provide near real time customer service and provide information about your account.

These examples make me wonder how I can provide a different interaction model. How can I make it easier on my clients to interact with me? How can I make it more delightful? Does that even make sense at our small size?
