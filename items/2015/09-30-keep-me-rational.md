title: Keep Me Rational
---
Here's some advice about interacting with me that might help you work with others like me too: don't back me into a corner.

I lose all rationality when I'm put in that position. I am likely to do something that isn't in my short term best interests just to be sure you don't get what you want. I'm not saying this is a good thing, I'm just saying this is how I react.

So give me an out. Give me options. Everyone wants to feel like they are in control.

And if it won't kill you, try to empathize with how I feel let me be in control of my stuff. And do that for everyone, not just me.
