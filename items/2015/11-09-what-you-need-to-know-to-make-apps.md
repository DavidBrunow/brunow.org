title: What You Need To Know To Make Apps
---
I'm tutoring a retired math professor on how to make an app. He wants to make one that targets kids and teaches them math.

Going into this tutoring I thought that I'd mostly be teaching coding, in particular Swift. But while he does need some guidance there I find the most productive information I can provide is how to break up the huge task of making an app into smaller, doable pieces.

I've made lots of things and it almost comes second-nature to me now -- I usually forget how critical of an ability it is. I don't know how easily it can be taught because it requires a skill that I don't see too often -- being able to see the big picture and its smaller pieces at the same time.
