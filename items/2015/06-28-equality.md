title: Equality
---
Far too slowly our country is starting to put into effect the kinds of policies that represent the America that I was told that we were while growing up. But thankfully, one more legal barrier to equality has been knocked down and now everyone can legally get married.

We still have a long way to go to get where we need to be -- a place where we all treat our sisters and brothers as though they are just like us. 

But this is one momentous step and I'm so happy to see it happen.
