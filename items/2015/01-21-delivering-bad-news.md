title: Delivering Bad News
---
I am awful at giving people bad news. If I were a doctor and had a patient with no legs I would tell her she would walk again.

I think being bad at bad news is natural. It's probably the default for most people. But it gets in my way too much and I don't want that anymore. I don't want clients to distrust me or to work 36 straight hours because I won't tell them that the project will take longer than we all estimated. I am an imperfect human and that's ok.

So I'm going to admit that imperfection and face up to it and see what happens.
