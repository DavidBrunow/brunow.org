title: Numbers That Don't Matter
---
Getting someone to show their "like" of something on social media is easy. It costs her next to nothing and may even give her a feeling of generosity -- isn't it great of her to like this thing? She's so great!

But those numbers don't matter. Turning a like into a sale is just about as hard as turning nothing into a sale. Getting likes is like eating a cookie or potato chip. It focuses your mind on that awesome taste and dulls your senses to everything else. You just want your high and doing good, hard work doesn't give fill that craving.

So if you are fortunate enough to have someone devoted solely to social media, then the number of likes they get may be a good way to measure their success. But don't think about it all the time. Don't let it distract you from the real work. Put yourself on a diet.
