title: Pushing It

Sometimes pushing yourself harder is not the right answer. I'm still up at 1:37 in the morning after being out celebrating the Fourth of July last night. I'm exhausted and barely awake but I just forced myself through all the tweets I've missed and I'm forcing out this post.

But I should be in bed. My health needs to come first, no matter what I've committed to.

Good night.
