title: Meaningless Rules
---
Sometimes I think it is good to give yourself meaningless rules. What I mean is to set a standard for yourself for no reason. Like "I will only send invoices on Tuesday afternoons." This rule can make the task stand out in your mind so you're less likely to forget it. And after a while the rule builds into something more -- a tradition, a part of your culture. It can be like the grain of sand inside an oyster.

But it doesn't have to be. After all, it is just a meaningless rule.
