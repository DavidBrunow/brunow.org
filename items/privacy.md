My privacy policy below will go into more detail, but in general, while my apps
may have access to your data they do not ever share that data with me or any
third party.

## Privacy Policy for David Brunow

### Overview

This privacy policy describes who I am and how the apps that I make collect,
store, use, and share your personal data. This policy also includes how you can
control the ways your personal data is affected.

### Who I Am

My name is David Brunow. I am an app developer living in Denton, Texas. You can
reach me by email at helloDavid@brunow.org.

### How My Apps Collect, Store, Use, and Share Your Personal Data

#### Wake Up Powered by RdioÂ® and Wake Up To Music

Starting with version 1.2.0 of Wake Up to Music and version 2.3.0 of Wake Up Powered By Rdio, 
the Wake Up Powered by Rdio and Wake Up To Music apps collect and store your
personal data with your permission but do not use or share it.

In specific, the apps collect when you set your alarm and when you turn it
off. This data is stored in the location that Apple built to store this type of
information in iOS called HealthKit in the Sleep Activity section. HealthKit is
a central place to store your health information and you can learn more about it
[here](https://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/health/). You can view what is
collected and stored through the Health app provided by Apple or through other
third party apps that you give access to your Sleep Activity data.

Before version 1.2.0 of Wake Up to Music and version 2.3.0 of Wake Up Powered By Rdio, 
the Wake Up Powered by Rdio and Wake Up To Music apps do not collect, store,
use, or share your personal data.

#### Dharma Talks

The Dharma Talks app does not collect, store, use, or share your personal data.

### How You Can Control Your Personal Data

#### Wake Up Powered by Rdio and Wake Up To Music
This information applies to version 1.2.0 of Wake Up to Music and version 2.3.0
of Wake Up Powered By Rdio, as neither of these apps collected, stored, used, or
shared your personal data before those versions.

Upon initial launch of the app you can choose whether you want your personal
information to be collected and stored.

At any time you can revoke access to your personal information through iOS's
Settings app. Specifically, open the Settings app, then select "Privacy," then
select "Health," and then select "Wake Up." There you can toggle the app's
access to collect and store data.

Through Apple's Health app you can delete any information collected and stored
by these apps.
