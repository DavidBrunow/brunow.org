title: The First Class
---
I'm a type of person that thinks and rethinks through interactions with people that don't go perfectly. I analyze details like how people reacted to things I said and agonize over any faux pas. And so last night, after teaching my first class at the local community college, I didn't sleep well.

I had four hours of class to mentally review, examine, and critique. Like that moment when I started saying "In addition to the state's goals for what y'all need to learn, I have two personal goals" but then forgot my second goal. I had planned that statement out so many times leading up to yesterday. It was embarrassing. 

But it is over and I'm ready to move forward. Live performances can never be perfect and I think I'll get better at accepting that over time. Right now I just can't wait to get back in there to teach the next lesson.
