title: Daddy Daughter Time
---
Tonight as I was feeding [my daughter][linkEmmaCan], she reached out her arms towards me and I leaned forward. 

She grabbed the sides of my face and moved my head towards her right side.

She paused and looked at me.

She moved my head towards her left side. And paused again, looking again.

Then she pushed my face away, and softly, with a tiny smile, 'cough cough'.

A huge smile spread over my face and my heart melted. 

_I'm 'cough cough'._ She knows me.
