title: Obligation
---
I just read [Wilson Miner's thoughtful piece on digging deep][linkWilsonMiner]. One of my favorite things about Wilson, and super smart people in general, is that they make you think in ways that you don't think naturally.

While I agree with Wilson, I would add a caveat. Yes, you absolutely should dig deep.
But
---
You have an obligation to dig deep into *important* problems. Another Twitter app, another way of fiddling with your email, or another technology based way of determining whether it is sunny outside *is not important*. 

How can we use technology to reduce childhood obesity, stop food waste, end hunger in other countries, fix the education system or ensure freedoms for everyone? Important stuff in need of smart people determined to see something through.

That's where we need to dig deep.
