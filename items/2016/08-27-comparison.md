---
It gets me nowhere but I find myself doing it. Seeing someone else doing something similar to me, experiencing a moment of not being enough, and then mentally fighting to find ways that I'm better. My silly little human mind has a hard time understanding that there's room for us all, getting caught up in the tiny world we see and ignoring everything beyond.
