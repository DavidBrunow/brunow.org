title: Growing Is Painful
---
I'm six and a half feet tall so it always felt like I was in a growth spurt as a kid. Painful shin splints became normal. I'm glad I'm past that point in my life.

As we get older and finish growing physically I think it is easy to forget that pain. We can forget that growth and pain go hand in hand. Instead of seeing that pain as natural we turn away from it and turn away from growing. We spend years being the same person we were the year before.

That might be fine for you. I'm sure it is more comfortable and stable than a life where you never stop growing. But it isn't for me. I'll take the pain and the knowledge that I haven't reached the top of my potential yet. I just have remind myself that this pain is natural on those tougher days.
