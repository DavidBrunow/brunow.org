title: Not One For Badges
---
I'm not the kind of person who cares about earning badges. Certifications, degrees, and other résumé fodder aren't my motivation. My motivation is getting things started. Moving things forward. Getting things done. 

I'm driven by part duty, part obsession, and part ego. Not by fancy paper.
