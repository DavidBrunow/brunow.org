Howdy!

On the [fourth episode of The David Brunow Podcast](https://brunow.org/podcast/) I’m still getting back on the horse after falling off a year ago, and this time I’m going to take things easier. I have a new, relaxed attitude towards creating my podcast and I’m drinking a scotch, neat.

On this episode I talked about my recent failures in trying to verbally explain ideas to others and my struggles with getting stressed out by trying to live in the future.
