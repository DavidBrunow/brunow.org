title: Limits On Patience
---
Thinking more about setting limits on patience, I'm nearing my first guideline. I'm not sure how clear to make it yet or if I should just leave it vague but it has to do with disrespect. I think that's one area where I don't need to be patient.

Obviously misunderstandings can happen so I can't simply always think I'm being disrespected and snap on people. But I should be able to see patterns of disrespect and act upon those.
