title: Rate Of Change
---
Knowing the rate at which technology moves forward is powerful because it would allow you to be in the right place at the right time. For example, Apple was able to create the iPhone when they did only because the right technologies had matured enough by that point. A year earlier it was impossible and a year later it was status quo.

The only way I can think of to know the rates of change is to be the one driving the change and even then you'll be off. But I imagine that watching from the outside and figuring out the timing is not possible.
