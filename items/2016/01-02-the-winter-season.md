title: The Winter Season
---
In a recent Mission Dharma [Dharma Talk](http://www.missiondharma.org/dharma-talks.html) Howie Cohn talked about winter. He mentioned plants going dormant and wildlife hibernating. He emphasized that this is the season for rest.

I'd never thought of winter this way. I'd been irritated by the short days and long nights. I'd been sad when the skies were gray for weeks at a time.

But the perspective Howie shared makes complete sense. I was trying to live in a way that was not in accord with the season -- I was trying to fight nature and therefore I was suffering.

Now I know to embrace this season of rest.
