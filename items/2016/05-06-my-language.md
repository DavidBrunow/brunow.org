title: My Language

My art may not speak to you. To you, it may seem boring, irrelevant, or in some cases obscene. That's OK for both you and me. You don't have to understand my language or get my perspective. And I don't have to change my message so you can understand. That would fundamentally change my art and my message.

We can both simply walk away, you knowing "that wasn't for me" and me knowing "that wasn't for you".
