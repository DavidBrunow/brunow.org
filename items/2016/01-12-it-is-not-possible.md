title: It Is Not Possible
---
Looking at history, we've done a bad job of predicting what is and isn't possible. In their day people believed that the sun rotated around the earth and that was the end of it. Or they believed it impossible that everything is made up of millions upon millions of tiny little things that we call atoms. Each of those previous generations didn't quite think they knew it all, but they thought they knew most of it.

I don't believe that we are any different today. We believe we know everything and ignore the larger everything else that we don't fully understand. I find it difficult to approach ideas while thinking "that isn't possible."
