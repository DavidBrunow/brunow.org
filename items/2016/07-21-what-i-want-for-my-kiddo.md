title: What I Want For My Kiddo
---
My daughter Emma was born with a condition called hydrocephalus which means that she had a lot of extra fluid in her head which limited the development of her brain -- there wasn't anywhere for it to grow. This has meant delays for her but despite those delays she's a happy, smart kid who can wheel her wheelchair where she wants to go, play the piano, and do many other things that doctors never thought she would.

I have high hopes for Emma and I read an article this morning that really touched me. What is described in [this article](http://mashable.com/2016/07/10/apple-innovation-blind-engineer/) is what I want for Emma. The details don't matter and I won't be pushing her towards anything in particular but I want her to show the world what she can do.
