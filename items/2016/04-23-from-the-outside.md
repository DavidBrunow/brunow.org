title: From The Outside
---
From the outside it always looks like things on the inside could be improved. Usually it looks easy too -- I find myself making comments like "they just need to do this to fix it". Sometimes that's true but usually not. Usually though you can find a way to learn more and either confirm your initial thoughts or figure out it is more complicated than you thought.

Learning more taking effort but so does actually solving the problem. When in doubt I ask questions rather than share opinions.
