title: A Place With Trees
---
I'm fortunate to live in a place with trees. Where I can walk under them, look up, and marvel at their size and age. Where it sounds like flowing water when the wind blows through the leaves. Where the morning sun streaks over the ground in patterns of shade and light. And the evening sun's golden rays find their way through the leaves to warm my body.
