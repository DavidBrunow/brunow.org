Today was the opening day for Denton's co-working space called Stoke. We are leasing an office there and I arrived right when they opened this morning. Since the place is brand new they are still getting some things taken care of and working through some initial issues. Like when I arrived this morning and the coffee maker hadn't been setup yet. And I had to wait to get connected to the wifi. And some things haven't arrived yet, like tables in the conference rooms.

That sort of thing might irritate people. The rough edges at the beginning of something new. But I love that.
