title: It Is Not The Quality
---
It's not the quality of the product alone that matters. Quality is important, yes, but it isn't enough. And it isn't mandatory. Many things have succeeded that weren't the highest quality option. And maybe that's a distinction that needs to be made -- quality only needs to be good enough. Otherwise you're over serving, wasting your time and resources and making your product worse.

So what does matter? What people think about your product. How using it makes them feel.

That's where marketing comes into play. Marketing's job is to make you feel good about buying and using a product. Its job is to make you believe that that is what people like you -- smart, discriminating people of course -- do.
