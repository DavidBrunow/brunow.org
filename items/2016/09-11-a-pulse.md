title: A Pulse
---
Living things have a pulse. They constantly move although sometimes in barely perceptible ways but we notice this change. At a basic level we differentiate between living and dead. We feel a sense of dread from seeing death.

The things we create can be moving and vibrant or static and dead. Each thing we create needs to move in a different way to fit its style but each needs to move.
