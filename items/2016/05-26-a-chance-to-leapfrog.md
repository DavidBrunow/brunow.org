title: A Chance To Leapfrog
---
When big things change it gives the new and fast-moving folks a chance to move ahead of the incumbents. For example, the Swift programming language came out shortly before we started our company. I'd written some Objective C (the language used for Apple device development before Swift) code before but it hasn't been my full-time job and I was behind many others in that skill set. But now I've been using Swift every day while they've continued to write Objective C and my skills in that area -- an area that is the future of all Apple product development -- is stronger than theirs. I've come from way behind to be ahead. I see that as a strong advantage.

Look around and you'll see that my example is just one of many times this has happened. Be on the lookout for your opportunity.
