title: Quality Standards

Everyone has a different answer for "what is good enough?" If you're growing and getting better at what you do then your quality bar will go up. If you surround yourself with people that have a higher quality bar then yours will go up too (or you'll get ejected from that group.) 

If you stop growing and getting better your quality bar doesn't stay the same, it drops. Same with surrounding yourself with people that have a lower bar. Few are strong enough to drive the rest of the group to improve quality by themselves.

Remember that quality isn't as simple as right and wrong. Low quality doesn't mean is wrong -- whether it is wrong depends on the circumstances. Similarly, high quality doesn't mean everything was done right.

For me, the right level of quality depends on how I want to be represented and whether I am practicing or performing. I have to ask "do I want this level of quality representing me?"
