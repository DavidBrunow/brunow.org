title: Pushing Too Hard
---
I can tell I've been pushing too hard lately. I feel boring and flat and that comes through in my blog posts. I haven't been getting enough sleep or enough variety -- most of my days have been work, although I did make sure to work extra during the week so I could spend time with my daughter this last weekend.

I don't like being in this place. I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle where I get overwhelmed and overworked every other month. I believe I need to make these sacrifices now for long term success, but I'm looking forward to stability.
