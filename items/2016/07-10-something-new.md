title: Something New

I got a tiny computer in the mail today, the [CHIP](http://getchip.com). I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it but while thinking about some possibilities I realized how little I know about this area of technology.

I think I've come up with a project that will be a good introduction to the tiny computer world. It seems like a simple concept to me -- I want to build a device that has a camera and that can take pictures when told to do so by an iPhone app. There isn't a lot of functionality there but thinking through the implementation I realized I have no idea how to do the key component of having the iPhone app talk to the device. I don't think I could even muddle my way through it without hours of research on the internet.

Seeing this new thing I have no clue about humbles and excites me. Every time I think I know a thing or two about the world of technology I quickly get brought back down to reality.
