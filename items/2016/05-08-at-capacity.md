title: At Capacity
---
I'm not good at knowing by limits. It isn't until I'm a ways past them that I notice that I'm at capacity -- that I've got no more time or energy to give. I realized this this past week as I tried to plan a birthday party along with everything else I had going on. I didn't do a good job of it because I had no room left. Even the smallest things become difficult when I'm at that point.

I do believe that I need to be in this situation right now to help our company survive. But I need to figure out the warning signs in the future because this isn't sustainable.
