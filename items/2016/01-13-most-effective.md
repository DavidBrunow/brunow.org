title: Most Effective

This last year I've been getting more involved with organizations than I've been. I've also been one of two people starting a company from nothing. As I always do, I have opinions on how things should be done. These opinions aren't set in stone -- more like they are set in hot liquid metal, still waiting to be cast into their shape. Writing and sharing them helps them form stronger and I'll share one now.

The number of members you have has a positive correlation to the impact your organization can make until a certain point. At that point, each member you have reduces your impact. That point is different for every organization because every one has different goals and members.

I'd argue the best way to figure out the right number is to work backwards. Figure out what impact you want to make and then figure out the minimum number of people you need to do it.
