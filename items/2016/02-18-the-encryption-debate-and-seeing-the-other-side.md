title: The Encryption Debate And Seeing The Other Side
---
I believe that back doors in any security system are bad. When the system is software based, I believe that back doors are even worse. This topic is in the headlines recently because the [FBI has asked Apple to create a back door for its systems and Apple doesn't want to do that](http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/). I side with Apple to the point of getting angry after just reading about this happening. I don't believe that perceived safety is more important than our liberties and I don't believe in fear driving our decisions. I also think it is a gross overstep of government powers to compel a private entity to do what they want outside of a time of emergency or war.

But a lot of smart people see things differently than I do and I don't want to ignore that. Any time smart people are heading in a direction I want to at least know why they are heading that way. I might not follow, but I want to be well informed enough to choose whether I should follow.
