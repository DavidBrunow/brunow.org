title: Lightweight Tools
---
I prefer lightweight tools for the things I do that aren't my primary work. For example, I consider building iOS apps as part of my primary work but I consider tracking my time as a secondary, although completely necessary, task. Tracking time is an overhead task -- something added on to the primary task that has to get done.

I want lightweight tools for those overhead tasks. No options, no thought, fast user interface. I want to type in what I'm working on and keep moving.
