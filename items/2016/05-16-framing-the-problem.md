title: Framing The Problem
---
The solution you need depends on the problem you have. That's obvious. But the problem you have isn't obvious.

I read a tweet this morning about how open floor plan offices are bad for your health. The first person that replied said "...I rarely see good solutions for maximizing floor space yet dealing with these issues." That person sees a different problem -- maximizing floor space -- than I see -- giving people a productive place to work.

Step #0 in solving a problem is figuring out what your problem is.
