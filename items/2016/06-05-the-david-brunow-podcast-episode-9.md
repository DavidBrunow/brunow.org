title: The David Brunow Podcast Episode 9 -- Learning from Smart People
---

Howdy!

On the ninth episode of The David Brunow Podcast I talked about the projects I'm currently working on, my thoughts on AI and big data, listening to and learning from very smart people, and how my previous efforts at doing this podcast have failed and how I'm trying to adapt to avoid that going forward.
