title: Things Line Up 
---
Sometimes -- many times -- things line up in my life in a way that is easy to follow. Like stepping stones through a creek bed I get something that's leading me in the right way to go. We've had a few of those over the last year and a half after starting out company. I find it is best to go with that easier path and let it take you where it will.
