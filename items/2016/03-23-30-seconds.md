Who are you in 30 seconds?

Can you share your life that quickly? Sum it all up nicely? Your likes, dislikes, passions, and prejudices? What spending a day with you is like? How you bend or break or give up under pressure?

Of course not.

After 30 seconds of your story I might know 2 things:

1) How much your practice your 30 second story
2) What you value or what you think I value

Is this valuable information? Is this a useful way to make any decision?
