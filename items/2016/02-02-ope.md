Other People's Expectations.

They are rarely reasonable. They don't know what you have going on or your plans or who you are. They want you to fit in with what suits them and fits their needs. Due to our social nature they can easily creep into our heads and convince us they were always there. That they are ours.

Fight them with communication and self reflection. Sometimes you only need to reset them by expressing yourself. You can only know what is yours and what is theirs by thinking about who you are, what you believe, and what you want.
