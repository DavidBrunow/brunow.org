title: Softer
---
Humans are far worse at survival today than 500 years ago. We can control our environment by adding light, controlling temperature, and keeping predators at bay. But we can work more hours of the day without the distractions of shivering or looking over our shoulder constantly. 

The benefits of our softness far outweigh any drawbacks. Having our lower needs satisfied means we can work on our higher needs. We can be better people and accomplish greater things.
