title: Quitter
---
I'm where I am today because I'm a quitter. I've never quit at the best times, like when I've had another better job lined up. But I've always turned one good job into another that's a better fit. That's required choosing to leave comfortable situations and putting myself at risk. But that's the only way I know to move forward. One leap at a time.
