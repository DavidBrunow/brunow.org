title: Because It Is Or Was Technologically Impossible
---
I'll continue talking about that moment after I've had an idea that I think is great. In that moment I ask myself the question "Why hasn't this been done before?" One possible answer to that question is "Because it is or was technologically impossible." I'll discuss this situation now.

When I find myself in this situation the first thing I need to do is figure out if the technological problem can be overcome. If it can't then the idea's done, at least for now. I can add it to a list of ideas to come back to in the future and move on to something else for now.

I can't remember a time I've found myself in the situation where something was impossible but isn't now. I've always been too busy with today to leave cushion for tomorrow. From what I've heard from others speed is critical in this situation. If you see something is newly possible then it is likely that others will see that too.

This is a risky situation but the most fun. It is risky because you need to invest resources without any sure indication that you'll have a market for what you've built at the end. It might be that people just don't care about what you've made or it might be that someone beats you to market and takes the customers that you would have had.

It is fun because you get to do something that no one else has ever done. That's the sort of possibility I need to find time to do.
