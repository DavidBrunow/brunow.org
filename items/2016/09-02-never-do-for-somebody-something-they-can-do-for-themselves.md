title: Never Do For Somebody Something They Can Do For Themselves
---
I heard this comment on a podcast today that was talking about homelessness in our community. I think that other than the "never" being a bit strong this is good everyday advice for all aspects of your life. Like when you want to make things easier for your kids when they're fully capable of doing something. Or when an employee asks you about something they they can look up themselves.
