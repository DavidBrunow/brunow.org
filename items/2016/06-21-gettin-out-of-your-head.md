title: Gettin Out Of Your Head
---
Our mind is shaped by what we expose it to. If I'm dissatisfied with my state of mind then the easiest way to make a change is to look at who and what I watch, read, and listen to and cut out the ones that aren't getting me where I want to be. Sheltering myself isn't always the right thing to do. As with all things there is a season for each -- a season to open myself up to new ideas and thoughts and a season to restrict those inputs. I'm starting to get fed up with those inputs so I think I'm heading into a new season.
