title: Continual Forward Progress
---
I think I've written about this subject before but it is worth repeating. The key to creating just about anything is continual forward progress. Knowing your goal and moving towards it for the first month, sixth month, first year, and tenth year. Maybe altering your course slightly as you learn more about the path ahead or the environment you're in, but not turning around and changing direction with every whim or shiny new thing.

When in doubt about how fast you should be going, slow down. Take time to rebuild your energy so you can keep pushing forward and don't expend it all at once.

Know where you want to go, more or less, and don't stop until you get there.
