title: A Minute To Breathe
---
The newest version of the Apple Watch software has built in reminders to take a minute to breathe. It guides you through taking deep breaths for one minute every four hours. I've been using it for the last few days and repeatedly find myself feeling like I don't have a minute to spare. When I do take the time I enjoy it but that enjoyment isn't enough to convince me to slow down for a moment. I think that says more about me than it does this new functionality.
