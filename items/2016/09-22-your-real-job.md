title: Your Real Job
---
You probably have a title that describes the sorts of things that you do on a day to day basis. Mine could possibly be software developer on most days. But my real job isn't developing software and if I think it is then I can very easily get caught up in the wrong things. My job is to solve problems using software. It is a subtle difference but important.
