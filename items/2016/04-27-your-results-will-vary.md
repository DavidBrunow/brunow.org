title: Your Results Will Vary
---
We're all different from each other in thousands of tiny ways. Those differences mean that it is more sure than "your results may vary", they will vary. That's why finding your path and happiness is important. Following my path or your coworker's or neighbor's won't work. You can see what we do and test to find out if it works for you but if it doesn't then that's OK.
