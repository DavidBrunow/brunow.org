title: Limitations Of Research
---
Researching what you want to do -- the project you want to bring to the world -- will only get you so far. You can't learn every lesson ahead of actually doing it. Research won't prepare you for how everything will work in your context. You'll learn more in one week of your product being in the wild with world you want to bring it to than you will over months of research.

Prepare yourself. But when in doubt pull the trigger on it.
