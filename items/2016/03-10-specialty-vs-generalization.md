title: Specialty Vs Generalization

Of course there's a place for both, but you'll probably lean one way or the other naturally. Figure out which way and get yourself in those kinds of situations.

I lean towards generalization. It suits me. I prefer working alone or on very small teams and controlling everything.

If you lean towards specialization then you need to be on a team, probably a fairly large one.

Neither is wrong. Each has their pluses and minuses.
