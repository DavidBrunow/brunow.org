title: There Is No Takeaway
---
It feels right to say "the lesson from this is..." and make a pronouncement about how you are now wiser and won't make that mistake again. But you can easily overdo it. Many outcomes are dependent upon the circumstances outside your control, most of which you cannot see. Don't let your takeaway put you into a box or turn into an equivalent of "don't take risks" because you'll lose any chance at greatness by doing so.
