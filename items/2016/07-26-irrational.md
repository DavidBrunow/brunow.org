title: Irrational
---
Despite thinking so most of the time, we aren't very rational creatures. Or I should probably say that we underestimate how much our decisions are influenced by irrational things. For example, tomorrow morning I have a meeting. The venue for this meeting recently changed from a restaurant with a wall of windows to one that is dimly lit and only has windows on one side which are far from where we sit. 

My subconscious is telling me that I don't want to go back to that dimly lit place despite there being many rational reasons why it is better -- the acoustics are better for large groups of people talking, the seating arrangements are more comfortable and better suited to conversation, and the restaurant has gone out of their way to make our experience as seamless and simple as possible.

But my subconscious wants sunlight and that's what pulls me.
