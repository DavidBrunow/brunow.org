title: It Is Not You, It Is Me
---
I don't overwork myself because I'm put in a bad work environment. I don't do it because I'll get in trouble or because people will be upset with me. I do it because it is in my nature. I do it because I don't make excuses and I don't let the ball drop.

If I don't like being overworked the solution is not to change my environment. It is to change myself.
