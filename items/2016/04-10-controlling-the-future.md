title: Controlling The Future
---
I find it easy to forget that the things happening to me right now usually started in the past and many time I set off that series of events. Sometimes it is as small as feeling the effects of drinking too much coffee six hours ago or as big as having to constrain my lifestyle to be able to afford to pay for my college loans a decade ago.

The good news is that when I recognize this I have a ton of control over why my future looks like. If I want to be able to sleep tonight then I'll stop drinking coffee before noon. If I want my financial situation to improve in a year then I'll watch my spending today or take actions to bring in more money now.

We don't have total control over the future but I think we have much more control than we'd usually think.
