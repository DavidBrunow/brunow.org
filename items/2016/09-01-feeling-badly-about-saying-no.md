title: Feeling Badly About Saying No
---
I've been on a kick lately about saying no to things. Apparently I've been pushed to my limit and can't handle anything else so everything is turning into a no. But I still feel like a jerk for saying no and I don't like feeling like a jerk. I start to apologize for saying no when I really meant it.
