title: Knowing Good Enough
---
"Good enough" depends on what you're doing. Are you trying to communicate an idea with the goal of getting feedback or are you trying to build something that competes with the best in the world?

Depending on how you work, you'll naturally tend toward one way or another -- you'll either tend to over or under deliver. Finding the sweet spot is difficult.

Again, ask yourself what you're trying to accomplish and whether what you have meets that goal. Know your natural tendency and try to factor it in.
