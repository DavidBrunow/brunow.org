title: Running Lean
---
I really like the idea of doing more with less. With getting things done with as few resources as possible. Using elegance and efficiency rather than brute force. Lotus cites this idea as their core philosophy and I love [the quote they cite](http://www.lotuscars.com/about-us/lotus-philosophy) from their founder, Colin Chapman, "Simplify, then add lightness". The reasoning behind it is that in racing every additional pound is constantly requiring more effort and therefore slowing you down by making it more difficult to accelerate, decelerate, and turn.

Running lean and using elegance and efficiency requires effort and nearly constant vigilance. The natural path for man-made things is to grow bloated, add more things, get more complicated, and reduce efficiency. "Simplify, then add lightness" can apply to more than just cars. It can apply to software, home appliances, lifestyles, and businesses.

How can you apply it in your life and work?
