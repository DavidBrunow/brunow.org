title: Build The App That I Would Want To Use
---
I think that I have an advantage over many other developers when it comes to
building apps for clients. I'm easily irritated by bad software and good at building apps that I would want to use. That doesn't mean excluding people that want to use apps differently but instead finding ways to make things easier to use. Because I'm lazy and easily irritated by things that are difficult.

Bring that touch of you into the things you build. Take the time to think about how you'd use it.
