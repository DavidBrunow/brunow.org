title: My Greatest Asset
---
My greatest asset is your trust. The fact that you know when I say something that I mean it. I'll be there when I say I will, I'll do what I say I'll do, and if I say your baby is cute then it really is.

Keeping your trust is not always comfortable. I have to have moments when I tell you that your haircut looks awful, your home decor looks like shit, and your dog looks like it came from a trash can. Always with love and kindness, but always honest.

Trust doesn't come overnight. Trust can't be forced or paid for. Trust is differentiation.
