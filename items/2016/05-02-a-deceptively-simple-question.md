title: A Deceptively Simple Question
---
1.) What is stopping you from getting what you want?

This question is difficult because you have to take an honest assessment of your life and your brain isn't very good at that. Your brain would rather tell you something is impossible rather than put your through discomfort. For example, if your group of friends engages in bad habits it is difficult for your brain to tell you that you need to leave your friends behind because they are making your life worse. Your brain might choose to blame -- yourself or your stressful job or your parents -- instead of seeing the impact of those people you care about.
