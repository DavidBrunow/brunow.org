title: Inside Out
---
Yesterday I finally got around to watching the movie Inside Out and I thought it was great. Today I've been thinking about one of the concepts in the movie and how it relates to my life.

The movie is about a pre-teen girl and the emotions that live in her head and control her mood, Joy, Sadness, Fear, and Anger. These emotions steer her through life and take over in the appropriate circumstances. All the while she is creating memories which are depicted as marbles which contain a short video of the memory and are tinted by the emotion that was in control at the time. Every once in a while a special kind of memory rolls in, called a core memory. These core memories power the fundamental structures of who she is as a person -- her passions and the things she cares about most deeply.

The part I'm trying to relate to my life is this concept of core memories. I know that Inside Out is just a movie and not a well researched documentary about how the world works. But I also love a good analogy and I find it fun to think about. The problem is that I have no idea what my core memories could be or what the fundamental structures of who I am are. I'm going to keep thinking about it and see what I can figure out.
