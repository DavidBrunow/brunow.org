title: Warning Signs
---
Pain is a warning sign that I'm doing something wrong. Something detrimental to my health. Lately it has been too much work sitting in front of a computer. Not enough moving, stationary for hours. I've pain in my back that feels like it's in my chest. Pain in my wrists, shoulders, hips.

My solution is not to go to a doctor. It is to get through this and then get rest and get movement. I need to use my body the way it was designed to be used.
