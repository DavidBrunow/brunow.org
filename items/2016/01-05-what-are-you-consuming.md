title: What Are You Consuming
---
I think it is a good time to look at what and how much you are consuming. I think it is helpful to look at across everything you consume, from what you buy at retail stores to what you eat to how much water and electricity you use. But I'm focused more on the media I consume right now.

I'm thinking through each media source -- Twitter, Facebook, blogs, Apple News, books, and TV. How much time do I spend on each a week? How much does each distract me from the bigger things I want to accomplish? How much does each enrich my life?

I'm going to watch myself over the next couple of weeks with these questions in mind and see if I want to make changes.
