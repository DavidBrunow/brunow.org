title: Z For Zachariah
---
I enjoyed watching a movie last night, Z for Zachariah. I liked it because it was simple and created an interesting situation.

The movie was simple in that it had only 4 characters, including a dog, and one setting. The situation was interesting because these three people were the last three on Earth (that we know of). The dynamic between them was awkward and human, as you'd expect.

This movie reminded me of how little you need to make a story. At the minimum you need a place, a character, and a situation (sometimes the place is the character, which is even simpler). Starting simple might be the best way to start to learn storytelling.
