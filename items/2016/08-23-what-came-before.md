title: What Came Before

If it weren't for Google, we wouldn't be able to run the business we do. But Google doesn't help us in the way you may think, like hosting our email or making our website easy for clients to find. No, Google helps because it allows us to do a task that used to take hours or day in minutes. Of course Stack Overflow gets credit for this too, but it was the fact that Google made a really good search engine that helped give us the confidence to say that we can solve any technology problem that a small business has.

I'm not a huge fan of Google in general, but I've got to give thanks.
