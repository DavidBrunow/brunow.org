title: Learning My Limitations
---
The last 18 months of starting a company and consistently striving to do better has taught me my limitations better than anything else. I've always been baffled by the thought of not being able to do something -- if anyone else can do it then I firmly believe that I can also. But now I see where someone else could probably do things better. I think that's progress.
