title: Constant Motion or Constant Forward Movement
---
I can put all my energy into something and still get nowhere with it. I can wave my hand back and forth so fast that you can barely see it. In the perfect situation my hand pushing against the air will move me somewhere. But I'll tire quickly and give up on moving because it obviously doesn't work.

By comparison, taking a step is slow. You can see my foot leave the ground and set back down again. A step requires coordination and less energy in the next minute but more energy over the next hour.

I don't want to wave my hand, I want to get somewhere. Sometimes it will feel like I'm not moving fast enough, but over time I'll see that I've moved longer and gotten farther. The hard part isn't quick bursts of energy and activity. The hard part is sustaining momentum, knowing where you want to go, and having the discipline to keep going until you get there.
