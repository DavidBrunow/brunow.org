title: Five Years Old
---
My daughter Emma was born five years ago today. It is been a bumpy five years with brain surgery on day 2, first 30 days or so in the NICU, blindness for the first 10 months or so, a hole in her heart that took years to close, eye surgery, a couple of seizures, and a few nights in the ER. Emma knows adversity.

You wouldn't know it by looking at her though because the hard times haven't gotten her down. Most of the time she is smiling, singing, playing her piano, or doing a combination of those. She's been remarkably resilient, further proving to me that life is amazing and will find a way.

Happy Birthday Emma. You make this world a much better place.
